\mt2 Gospel of
\mt1 Matthew
\ip The Book of Matthew is the first book of the four gospels in the New Testament. This gospel is believed to have been circulated to others by 70 A.D, and, as with the four other gospels, chronicles the life and works of Jesus. Its goal seems to have been to convince Jewish readers that Jesus is indeed the Messiah, through demonstrating Jesus's works and how his ministry fulfills Old Testament scripture. The earliest manuscripts of Matthew discovered so far are written in Greek, suggesting that Matthew's native tongue was Greek.\f + \ft www.biblica.com\f*

\p
\v 1 The ancestry of Jesus Christ, descendant of David, descendant of Abraham: \f - \fr 1:1 \ft "Descendant" is more accurate than "son."\f*
\p
\v 2 \w Abraham\w* fathered \w Isaac\w*; and \w Isaac\w* fathered Jacob; and \w Jacob\w* fathered Judah and his brothers; \f - \fr 1:2 \ft While begat is a somewhat unusual word, it is understood throughout the world and hard to replace without resorting to the passive.\f*
\p
\v 3 And Judah fathered \w Pharez\w* and \w Zerah\w* of \w Tamar\w*, and Pharez fathered \w Hezron\w*, and Esrom fathered \w Ram\w*, \f - \fr 1:3 \ft Original Hebrew transliterations are given here, with links to their biographies. The Greek versions of the names appeared in the \w Septuagint\w*.\f*
\p
\v 4 And Ram fathered \w Amminadab\w*, and Amminadab fathered \w Nahson\w*, and Naason fathered \w Salmon\w*,
\p
\v 5 And Salmon fathered \w Boaz\w* of \w Rahab\w*, and Boaz fathered \w Obed\w* of \w Ruth\w*, and Obed fathered \w Jesse\w*,
\p
\v 6 And Jesse fathered King \w David\w*, and King David fathered \w Solomon\w* (whose mother was the former wife of Uriah),
\p
\v 7 And \w Solomon\w* fathered \w Rehoboam\w*, and Rehoboam fathered \w Abijah\w*, and Abijah fathered \w Asa\w*,
\p
\v 8 And \w Asa\w* fathered \w Jehoshaphat\w*, and Jehoshaphat fathered \w Jehoram\w*, and Jehoram fathered \w Uzziah\w*, \f - \fr 1:8 \ft King Jehoram was \it not\it* the father of Uzziah, but rather was his great-grandfather. Kings \w Joash\w* and \w Amaziah\w* are left out because they were unworthy of being remembered. Joash killed \w High Priest\w* \w Zachariah I\w*, and Amaziah "did right,...but not with a whole heart."\f*
\p
\v 9 And Uzziah fathered \w Jotham\w*, and Jotham fathered \w Ahaz\w*, and Ahaz fathered \w Hezekiah\w*, \f - \fr 1:9 \ft The inclusion of King Ahaz is truly remarkable, considering Ahaz' less-than-honorable history.\f*
\p
\v 10 And Hezekiah fathered \w Manasseh\w*, and Manasseh fathered \w Amon\w*, and Amon fathered \w Josiah\w*, \f - \fr 1:10 \ft Hezekiah and Josiah were the two finest reformers in the entire king list of the \w Kingdom of Judah\w*\f*
\p
\v 11 And Josiah fathered \w Jeconiah\w* and his brothers, at the time of the exile in Babylon, \f - \fr 1:11 \ft Kings \w Jehoahaz II\w* and \w Jehoiakim\w* are left out, as is Jeconiah's uncle \w Zedekiah\w*.\f*
\p
\v 12 And after the exile in Babylon, Jeconiah fathered Salathiel, and Salathial fathered \w Zerubbabel\w*, \f - \fr 1:12 \ft "Zorobabel" and "Zerubabel" are two equally valid pronunciations of this Hebrew name. Zerubbabel was governor of what became the Judea Province of the Persian Empire under King \w Darius I\w* and his successors.\f*
\p
\v 13 And Zerubbabel fathered Abihud, and Abihud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor,
\p
\v 14 And Azor fathered Zadoc, and Zadoc fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Eliud,
\p
\v 15 And Eliud fathered Eleazar, and Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob,
\p
\v 16 And Jacob fathered \w Joseph\w*, the husband of Mary, whose child was \w Jesus Christ\w*. \f - \fr 1:16 \ft The preceding lineage establishes the legal claim that Jesus has to the throne of King David, consistent with a specific promise that God made to King David that a king would inherit his title and rule the world forever.\f*
\p
\v 17 So it was fourteen generations from Abraham to King David, and fourteen generations from King David until the exile in Babylon, and fourteen generations from the exile until Jesus Christ. \f - \fr 1:17 \ft These are fourteen generations chosen for special memory. In fact, the generations from David to the exile number seventeen. Three of the Kings of Judah are left out because they were unworthy; they are \w Joash\w*, \w Amaziah\w*, and \w Jehoiakim\w*.\f*
\p
\v 18 The birth of Jesus Christ happened this way:  His mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, but before they were married, she became pregnant with the child of the Holy Spirit. \f - \fr 1:18 \ft In ancient Judea, an engagement was a legal obligation much stronger than a modern "engagement." The only cause sufficient to break an engagement was immoral behavior by one party or the other. In this case, Mary was found to be pregnant, and that was considered evidence of \w adultery\w* by her. (Joseph did not yet know the circumstances of the pregnancy; he would find that out later.)\f* \f - \fr 1:18 \ft The \w Greek\w* phrase \bd πνευμα αγιος\bd* (Pneuma hagios) literally means "Holy Breath." However, \bd πνευμα\bd* also means a class of being not having a body, and usually having a certain amount of power. "God's will" or perhaps "God's love" is descriptive of the function of this Entity.\f*
\p
\v 19 Her husband Joseph was a righteous man, and did not want to publicly shame her. So he decided to divorce her privately. \f - \fr 1:19 \ft This emphasizes that Joseph is right to object to suspected adultery, but that even in these circumstances, divorce is a last option. Furthermore, "divorce" in this context is the breaking of an engagement, and the voiding of an obligation to marry the girl. Joseph could have insisted on making a public example (δειγματίσαι) of Mary, but was righteous (δίκαιος) and did not wish to put Mary through that.\f*
\p
\v 20 While he thought about this, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as a wife, because her pregnancy is due to God's will. \f - \fr 1:20 \ft Joseph discovers that the cause of the pregnancy is \it not\it* adultery, as he had feared.  "God's will" captures the meaning well, almost as the force of logic once God decided to appear in this world.\f*
\p
\v 21 And she shall bring forth a son, who you must name Jesus, for He will save his people from their sins." \f - \fr 1:21 \ft The name \it Jesus\it* (\w Hebrew\w*: \bd ישןע\bd*, \it Yeshua\it*; \w Greek\w* \bd Ιησους\bd*) literally means "\w God\w* saves."\f*
\p
\v 22 This entire affair happened in order to fulfill the spoken word from the Lord, through the prophet (\w Isaiah\w*), which states:
\p
\v 23 "A virgin shall be pregnant, and give birth to a son, who will be named Emmanuel," which means "God is with us." \f - \fr 1:23 \ft \w Isaiah 7:14\w* , originally in the \w Septuagint\w*.\f*
\p
\v 24 Therefore, when Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had instructed him, and wed Mary.
\p
\v 25 And did not consummate the marriage until she bore her son, who Joseph named Jesus.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 When Jesus was born in \w Bethlehem\w* in \w Judea\w*, during the reign of King \w Herod\w*, a number of scholars came to \w Jerusalem\w* from the east. \f - \fr 2:1 \ft "Scholars" captures the concept better in contemporary English than "wise men" or "astrologers".  They were learned men, which at that time included study of \w astrology\w* and dream interpretation. The Greek manuscript literally calls them "mages," but no evidence exists that any of them practiced sorcery, thaumaturgy, or any similar art. Their number is \it not\it* given in any extant manuscript. They brought three categories of gifts (see below), but they were \it not\it* three in number and probably were a much larger party.\f* \f - \fr 2:1 \ft While this passage is commonly taught as the revelation of Christianity to Gentiles, another interpretation is the revelation of Christ to scholars, opening the door to vast \w Biblical Scientific Foreknowledge\w*.\f*
\p
\v 2 They asked, "where is the child who was born as the King of the Jews?  We saw his star in the eastern sky, and we came here to worship him." \f - \fr 2:2 \ft The star was probably the \w planet\w* \w Jupiter\w*, which in the year of their trip (probably 1 BC) had made its every-twelve-year apparent reversal of course and had conjoined three times with \w Regulus\w*, the "King Star," also known as Alpha Leonis because it is the brightest star in the constellation Leo, meaning \w lion\w*. The lion has always been a symbol of \w Judah\w*, his tribe, and the kingdom that bore his name under King David (for seven years) and the successors of Solomon.\f*
\p
\v 3 When King Herod heard these things, he was agitated, as was all of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 4 So he gathered all the leading priests and the scribes, and demanded that they tell him where Christ would be born. \f - \fr 2:4 \ft Herod probably summoned the members of the \w Sanhedrin\w* and interrogated them.\f*
\p
\v 5 And they said to him, "He will be born in Bethlehem which is in Judea, in fulfillment of the prophecy, which states:
\p
\v 6 "You, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are not the least of the provinces of Judah, for out of you shall come a King who shall rule all Israel."
\p
\v 7 Then Herod spoke privately with the scholars and carefully asked them when the star would appear which would announce Christ's birth.
\p
\v 8 So he sent them to Bethlehem with the instructions, "Go, and search diligently for the baby, and when you have found him, tell me, so that I can come and worship him."
\p
\v 9 When they had heard the King's instructions, they departed. To their great surprise, the star which they saw in the east reversed direction, until it came to a standstill, seemingly directly over the location where the child was. \f - \fr 2:9 \ft Literally, a toddler. Jesus was not an infant anymore.\f* \f - \fr 2:9 \ft The Greek text, rendered "went before," is actually consistent with the retrograde motion of the planet Jupiter. All planets that are further out from the Sun than earth move apparently retrograde once every synodic year.\f*
\p
\v 10 When they saw the star, they felt the greatest joy.
\p
\v 11 And when they went into the house, they saw the child with His mother Mary, and they fell down and worshiped Him.  And they opened their bags and presented Him gifts of \w gold\w*, \w incense\w*, and oil of \w myrrh\w*. \f - \fr 2:11 \ft Matt 2:11 specifies frankincense and myrrh. Each of the gifts given to Jesus has a special significance. Gold has always been the metal of royalty, and emphasizes Christ's Kingship. Frankincense has always found use as a natural wound healer, and myrrh has always been used as a preservative used in funeral preparations. Thus frankincense and myrrh prefigure Christ's ministry of healing (spiritual as well as physical) and His death and Resurrection.\f*
\p
\v 12 God warned these men in a dream that they should not return to King Herod, so they went to their own country by an alternate route. \f - \fr 2:12 \ft That God gave the warning directly is an assumption. That God was \it instrumental\it* in the giving of that warning is certainly a safe assumption.\f*
\p
\v 13 Once they had departed, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Take the young child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you otherwise: for King Herod will be searching for the infant to kill him."
\p
\v 14 When he woke up, he took the infant and His mother that night and fled to Egypt.
\p
\v 15 There they stayed until the death of Herod, so that the words of the Lord's prophet would be fulfilled, which said "Out of Egypt have I beckoned my son."
\p
\v 16 Herod was very angry when he saw the scholars had deceived him.  He gave orders than all infants two years old and younger in Bethlehem and the neighboring coastlines be killed, as this would assuredly kill any infant born at the time the scholars had told him.
\p
\v 17 This is how the prophecy of Jeremy was fulfilled, which said,
\p
\v 18 "In Rama a weeping and mourning voice was heard, for Rachel wept for her children, and could not be comforted, because they are not alive." \f - \fr 2:18 \ft This verse directly quotes the \w Septuagint\w*.\f*
\p
\v 19 When Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, who was in Egypt. \f - \fr 2:19 \ft \w Herod\w* probably died in 1 BC.\f*
\p
\v 20 And the angel said, "Rise, and take the infant and His mother, and go to Israel, for those who sought to kill Him are dead."
\p
\v 21 So he rose, and took the infant and His mother, and went to \w Israel\w*.
\p
\v 22 When he heard that Archelaus reigned in Judea as successor to his father Herod, Joseph was afraid to go there, but on God's instructions, he entered into the region around Galilee,
\p
\v 23 and settled in a city called \w Nazareth\w*.  This fulfilled the prophecy, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
\c 3
\p
\v 1 In those times there was a man called \w John the Baptist\w*, who preached in the deserts of \w Judea\w*. \f - \fr 3:1 \ft Literally, "John the Baptizer."\f*
\p
\v 2 He would say, "You must repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near!" \f - \fr 3:2 \ft The Greek verb \bd μετανοεω\bd* literally means "I change my mind." Repentance means a change of heart and mind, and a turning away from a prior path.\f*
\p
\v 3 John the Baptist was the man prophesied by \w Isaiah\w*, who spoke of "the voice of a man crying out in the desert, 'Prepare the path of the Lord!'"
\p
\v 4 John the Baptist had a shirt made of camel's hair and a leather loincloth, and he ate \w grasshoppers\w* and wild \w honey\w*. \f - \fr 3:4 \ft "Locusts" refers to a swarm of any of various grass-eating insects, most commonly the \w grasshopper\w*, but also (in America) the \w cicada\w*. "Wild honey" is honey taken from any hive that is not specifically maintained and entails getting stung. These descriptions of the clothing and diet of John the Baptist emphasize his character as "roughing it" and living quite literally off the land. A hairshirt is uncomfortable and the act of wearing a hairshirt, or cilice, as an act of penance persists among Catholics today. This eccentric description of John shows him in a state of literally physical discomfort, wearing poor clothing and eating poor food, as an act of penance as he wanders the desert preaching.\f*
\p
\v 5 And many citizens of Jerusalem, and of all the neighboring regions, went out to John the Baptist,
\p
\v 6 and were baptized by him in the Jordan river as they confessed their sins. \f - \fr 3:6 \ft "Baptism" literally means washing by total body immersion.\f*
\p
\v 7 When John saw how many Pharisees and Sadducees came to be baptized by him, he said to them, "You jerks! Who has warned you to flee from the \it divine\it* sentence that's coming \it to you\it*? \f - \fr 3:7 \ft The phrase \bd Γεννηματα εχιδνων\bd*, "sons of snakes," is an insult, akin to "sons of (female dogs)" or "bastards" or simply "jerks."\f* \f - \fr 3:7 \ft The word rendered "wrath" is \bd οργη\bd*, which refers to the attitude of a magistrate before whom a convict appears for sentencing. In this context, they are clearly attempting to flee from God's justice by baptism. John finds this richly ironic, because he knows that Pharisees and Sadducees would be united in their "citified" contempt of him, because he's a roughneck who doesn't "dress properly," and everyone in Jerusalem surely knows it.\f*
\p
\v 8 "\it If you want to escape that fate,\it* show \it in your lives\it* fruits that deserve to be called fruits of repentance.
\p
\v 9 "Do not think to yourself, 'We have \w Abraham\w* as our patriarch, \it and are saved on that account\it*." For I tell you now that God could make these stones into children of Abraham \it if He wanted to\it*." \f - \fr 3:9 \ft God is no Respecter of persons, or of their races or national or clannish origins.\f*
\p
\v 10 "Already the ax is about to fall on the roots of the trees. So every tree that does not bring forth good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
\p
\v 11 On the one hand, I baptize you with water, as you repent: but on the other hand he who will come after me is far mightier, and I don't deserve to carry his shoes.  He will immerse you in God's will, and in fire.
\p
\v 12 His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will rid his threshing-floor \it of all impure elements\it*, and gather his wheat into his barn; and he will burn  the chaff with a fire that cannot be quenched. \f - \fr 3:12 \ft The Greek word \bd ασβεστος\bd*, meaning "unquenchable", survives as the term \w asbestos\w*, a mineral once prized as a flame-retardant.\f*
\p
\v 13 Now Jesus came from Galilee to Jordan, to be baptized by John.
\p
\v 14 But John begged Him to stop, saying, "No, I need to be baptized by you, not you by me."
\p
\v 15 And Jesus in answer said to him, "Allow yourself to baptize me, for it is necessary and proper."  So John allowed it.
\p
\v 16 And Jesus, once He was baptized, rose out of the water and the heavens opened for him, and the spirit of God descended like a dove upon Him.
\p
\v 17 And a voice spoke from heaven, saying, "This my beloved Son, with whom I am very pleased."
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Then God's will led Jesus into the desert to be tested by the devil.\f - \fr 4:1 \fk Alternative: \ft Then Jesus was lead by the Holy Spirit into the desert to be tried by the devil."\f* \f - \fr 4:1 \ft The word traditionally rendered "to tempt" means "to test," as an engineer will test a new material or assembly, often "to failure." This was Jesus' Final Examination.\f* \f - \fr 4:1 \fk Alternative: \ft The Greek word \bd διάβολος\bd* derives from the verb \bd διαβάλλω\bd*, which literally means "to throw across." The traditional rendition, "devil," is a contraction of the Greek word.\f* \f - \fr 4:1 \ft The Aramaic (Syriac)  Peshitta   provides understanding and is important not only because if is the first  translation after the Greek original but also because it captures the "aramaisms in the original  Greek and as some have pointed out, either orally or written, it provides the Aramaic sources from which the Original Greek, that is the earliest we have, might be a translation and reworking. \f* \f - \fr4:1 \fk Spirit \ft "Spirit" in Greek, "Holy Spirit" in Aramaic ( Ruha d Qudsha)\f* \f - \fr4:1 \fk Jesus was led \ft Important to leave as the Greek has it the passive. \f*
\p
\v 2 And after having fasted for 40 days and nights, Jesus began to be hungry. \f - \fr 4:2 \ft Greek and Syriac strongly imply that Jesus felt no hunger until the end of the 40 days and nights of fast.\f*
\p
\v 3 And the Tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread." \f - \fr 4:3 \ft "eipe"  say, literally say. Less literally but better English, "tell" these stones to become bread. Then Jesus would have been told by the devil to speak to the stones. I think that the KJV "command" is the best.\f*
\p
\v 4 But Jesus answered and said, It is written, "Man does not live by bread alone, but also by every word coming from the mouth of God. \f - \fr 4:4 \fk Alternative: \ft "But Jesus said in answer, "Scripture says: The life of Man is not just about consuming food, but about consuming the message of God."\f* \f - \fr 4:4 \ft The solemn and sonorous Biblical "answered and said" is proliptic and should be retained. It is there to tell us that we are about to hear Holy Writ. "It is written", is literal , understandable , and Hebraic all at once.\f*
\p
\v 5 Then the devil took him into the holy city, and stood him up on the pinnacle of the \w Temple\w*.
\p
\v 6 The devil said to Him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. Yes, it is written,  "Concerning you, He will command His angels and they will bear you up in their hands so that not even your foot will hit rock. " \f - \fr 4:6 \ft The word \bd αγγελος\bd* literally means "messenger."\f*
\p
\v 7 Jesus told him, "Scripture also says, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'" \f - \fr 4:7 \ft God will provide Divine protection up to a point, but to rely on Him to bail one out of the consequences of bad judgment is bad form. In fact, Satan suggests that Jesus be a magical or wonder-working Messiah, and Jesus rejects that advice as well.\f*
\p
\v 8 Again the devil took Him up to an extremely tall mountain, and showed him all the nation-states of the world and \it all\it* their glory,\f - \fr 4:8 \fk Alternative: \ft "And again the the devil  took Him up a very high  mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world with  all their magnificence"\f* \f - \fr 4:8 \ft The \w Greek\w* word \bd βασιλεια\bd*, a kingdom, is rendered "nation-state" here because it can stand for any nation-state having any form of government. Representative republics were not known at the time that the Evangelists and Apostles wrote, though they had been known earlier. All heads-of-state with whom these writers were familiar held titles that would translate today as "king" or "emperor." But when Satan shows Jesus all the nation-states of the world, he does not limit this vision only to those nation-states known to the Evangelists, or even only to those nation-states then existing. Rather, Satan demonstrates all nation-states, past, present, and future, as if to say that the governments of men have always been Satan's to bestow on anyone. Such is the measure of Satan's incomparable pride.\f*
\p
\v 9 and told him, "I will give You all these things, if You will fall down and worship me." \f - \fr 4:9 \ft Satan now offers Jesus the chance to be a political Messiah, One Who uses raw political power.\f*
\p
\v 10 Then Jesus told him, "Get away from me, Satan. Scripture says, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve Him alone.'"
\p
\v 11 Then, when the devil left Him, the angels came and served Him. \f - \fr 4:11 \ft The "behold" asking us to see, and we do and we see, after the devil has left, or as he is leaving, the angels, in their turn, are coming in.\f* \f - \fr 4:11 \ft The word used is \bd διακονεω\bd*, which means "I wait on someone like a table waiter." From this root comes the Greek word \bd διακονος\bd* a table waiter, which survives today as the word \it \w deacon\w*\it*.\f*
\p
\v 12 Now when Jesus had heard that John had been arrested, he went away into \w Galilee\w*;
\p
\v 13 And leaving Nazareth, he came and settled in Capernaum, which is on the seacoast, near the border between the \it tribal lands of\it* Zebulun and Naphthali,
\p
\v 14 in order that the words might be fulfilled that were spoken by \w Isaiah\w* the \w prophet\w*, who said,
\p
\v 15 "The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphthali, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan River, Galilee of the Gentiles; \f - \fr 4:15 \ft The \w Greek\w* word \bd εθνοι\bd*, "nations," is rendered "Gentiles" from the \w Latin\w* \it gens, gentis\it* meaning "the nation", or more literally, "the clan."\f*
\p
\v 16 "The people that sat in darkness saw a great light; and to them that sat in the region and shadow of death light has dawned."
\p
\v 17 From that moment Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Change your hearts, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." \f - \fr 4:17 \ft Here the Greek word \bd βασιλεια\bd* is properly rendered "kingdom" because \w God\w* is, always was, and always will be, a King in the truest sense of that word.\f*
\p
\v 18 Now Jesus, as He walked by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew, as they were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. \f - \fr 4:18 \ft This sea is known today as Lake Tiberias. The name \it Peter\it* means "rock."\f*
\p
\v 19 And he told them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of people." \f - \fr 4:19 \ft The context—speaking to two rugged fishermen—makes it clear that the masculine meaning of ανθρωπων was the connotation.  In modern terminology, no few would use a football analogy with a gender-neutral pronoun.\f* \f - \fr 4:19 \ft ανθρωπος is a gender-neutral word, which means 'person', not 'man'. What you would like this verse to mean isn't relevant. \f*
\p
\v 20 And immediately they left their fishing nets behind and followed Him.
\p
\v 21 And going on from that place, He saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee, and his brother John, in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets; and He called them.
\p
\v 22 And immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him.
\p
\v 23 And Jesus traveled throughout the whole of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, and healing every kind of chronic illness and every kind of germ among the people.
\p
\v 24 And the news of him spread throughout the whole of \w Syria\w* (Province), and \it people\it* brought to him the sick people having various diseases and torments, all demon-oppressed people, and mentally disturbed people, and paralyzed people, and He healed them. \f - \fr 4:24 \ft The \w Greek\w* word \bd σεληνιαζομαι\bd* means "I am struck by the \w moon\w*." This was the popularly suspected cause of most mental disturbance in those times. Here Matthew clearly distinguishes between ordinary mental illness and oppression or possession by demons.\f*
\p
\v 25 And great crowds of people followed Him from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from \w Jerusalem\w* and \w Judea\w* and from the far side of the Jordan River.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 After seeing the masses before Him, he ascended the Mountain, then He sat down*[to be foot-noted at bottom]. Those who were learning from Him, came to Him \f - \fr 5:1 \ft The \w Greek\w* word \bd μαθητης\bd* means a disciple.\f* \f - \fr 5:1 \ft What would have been understood by the original hearers and readers of Gospel of Matthew - Jesus was the fulfiller and then the displacer of Moses, viewing the crowd, as Moses did, Jesus ascended (dignified reminiscent of the Original Event, and when He got to the top, He SAT DOWN. That is mentioned, seemingly unimportant but actually very important. "Sitting down" was the 1st century act which meant "assumning authority". That is why there was a "seat of Moses" in the synagogue which Jesus said the Pharasees were presently occupying (that is why also the early bishops were represented as sitting with their clergy around them). His Learners - Talmidim (thus the Syriac and Hebrew behind the Greek Mathntns. Talmidim/mathntns does not really mean "pupil" which to the modern ear brings in "classroom", but rather followers or learners by seeing and hearing and doing - apprentices, if you will) came to him. \f*
\p
\v 2 He began His Torah*[to be foot-noted at bottom] to them, then, and said: \f - \fr 5:2 \ft  Jesus would have had to "open His mouth" in order for him "to say", but it was important to put it this way to thrust the reader to the sonorous solemnity of the Scriptures Va Ya'an vaYomer = He responded (when it was really not a response) and said. What they heard, so the original readers of the Gospel of Matthew would have now learned by this preface, is the new Torah from the One who was greater than Moses, having taken his place on "the mountain" ("mountain" here has an article - "the" precisely because it is specified, though unnamed, in contradistinction to the Mt. Sinai of Moses). The Gospel of Luke has the "sermon" on the plain while Matthew has it on the mountain. Both are correct as it is a plain going on up to the top of a mount on the north shore of the Lake. But Matthew chooses to call it "mountain" precisely because he is presenting the greater than Moses. The hearers and readers of the Gospel of Matthew would not be surprised then to hear later on in the "Sermon on the Mount" (better it be called " The Torah of the Messiah" or the "Law of the Kingdom"), " You have heard it said...but I say to you..." They would understand that the displacer and surpasser of Moses was getting the Torah directly from the Father, and no more would they have need of the line of rabbis and teachers to go back to the time of Moses. Somehow what the original readers and hearers of the Gospel would have understood must come through in the modern language. How that can be done is both an art and a miracle.\f*

\v 3 Blessed are those who are not full of the themselves, for the Kingdom of heaven is theirs.\f - \fr 5:3 \fk Alternative: \ft "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven."\f* \f - \fr 5:3 \ft The \w Greek\w* word \bd μακαριος\bd*, "blessed," comes from \bd μη\bd* (not) and the root \bd καρ-\bd* which connotes being cut off. Thus when Jesus says that people are blessed, He means that they will not be cut off from God.\f* \f - \fr 5:3 \fk Alternative: \ft The Greek word \bd ουρανος\bd*, literally "sky", is always rendered in the plural. (In the Old Testament it was rendered in the Hebrew dual number.)\f* \f - \fr 5:3 Here and in the rest of the "beatitudes", blessed is a good translation but behind the makarios is the ASHRAIcem, ASHRAIhem of the Hebrew rather than barukh. Ashrai  is used for the palpable and overflowing blessing and presence of God rather than the consecratory state, The root of ashrai is used for "happiness" Change in word order for the this and the rest of beatitudes is permitted by grammar and brings the true and unexpected reversal which is the teaching of Christ. \f*
\p
\v 4 Blessed are those who are grief-stricken, for they will be comforted. \f - \fr 5:4 \fk Alternative:\ft  "Blessed are the sad, for they shall be comforted."\f*
\p
\v 5 Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
\p
\v 6 Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. \f - \fr 5:6 \ft The use of the Greek accusative case connotes persons who actively do and pursue righteousness in their daily living.\f*
\p
\v 7 Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.
\p
\v 8 Blessed are the clean in heart, for they shall see God. \f - \fr 5:8 \ft The \w Greek\w* word \bd καθαρος\bd* means "clean." The English word \it pure\it* has its roots in metallurgy and connotes a refined metal element separated in a furnace. That metaphor is used elsewhere in Scripture, but not here.\f*
\p
\v 9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. \f - \fr 5:9 \ft developed from the Scripture and current in the 1st cent. and common in the synagogual liturgy - "The One who makes Peace in His Heights, He will make Peace upon us." As God is called according to this His quality, so those who follow Him in this, will also be called, a new name - "Children of God"\f*
\p
\v 10 Blessed are they that are persecuted for the sake of justice, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven. \f - \fr 5:10 \ft The Greek preposition \bd ενεκεν\bd*, used with the ablative, means "for the sake of." Here Matthew refers to those who suffer for the cause of justice, whereas before he referred to those who sought to deal justly themselves.\f*
\p
\v 11 Blessed are you, when \it men\it* shall denounce you, and persecute you, and say everything evil against you (falsely), for My sake. \f - \fr 5:11 \ft Some Greek manuscripts omit the word translated as "falsely."\f*
\p
\v 12 Rejoice, and be very glad, because your reward is great in heaven: because they persecuted the prophets that came before you in the same manner.
\p
\v 13 You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt has become bland, what shall it be salted with? It is then good for nothing, and fit only to be thrown out and trodden underfoot by men.
\p
\v 14 You are the light of the world. A city cannot be hidden if it stands on a hill.
\p
\v 15 And men do not light a candle and put it under a bushel basket, but on a candlestick; and it shines on everyone in the house.
\p
\v 16 Let your light shine in this manner in front of people, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.
\p
\v 17 Do not think that I have come to tear down the law or the prophets. I have not come to tear these things down, but rather to fulfil them.
\p
\v 18 For I tell you truly: Until heaven and earth, not one jot or tittle shall pass from the law, in any way, shape or form, until everything is fulfilled. \f - \fr 5:18 \ft The Greek letter \it iota\it* derives from the \w Hebrew\w* \bd י\bd* or \it yod\it*, commonly called a "jot" on account of its small size. The phrase "one iota" survives today in common English and means exactly what it meant to St. Matthew: a tiny amount.\f* \f - \fr 5:18 \ft The prime-mark is the \w Hebrew\w* \it gerash\it*, called \bd κεραια\bd* or \it keraia\it* in Greek; this was called a "tittle" in Elizabethan \w English\w*. The \it gerash\it*, or the double-prime called \it gershayim\it* (dual number), appeared often in Hebrew manuscripts to distinguish numbers (written with ordinary alphabetic letters) from regular text.\it Alternative view\it*: the phrase 'not one jot or tittle' has passed into everyday English and is generally understood. 'iota' and 'prime-mark' are terms with which few people are familiar.\f*
\p
\v 19 And so if any person breaks even one of the least of these commandments, and shall so instruct others, that person shall be called the least in the Kingdom of heaven: but any person who does and teaches the commandments, shall be called great in the Kingdom of heaven.
\p
\v 20 For I tell you that unless your justification exceeds the justification of the scribes and the Pharisees, you cannot enter the Kingdom of heaven under any circumstances. \f - \fr 5:20 \ft The manner of that justification will be explained later. Jesus makes a point of setting the bar higher than any man can scale by relying on his own strength.\f*
\p
\v 21 You have heard that it was said in ancient times, "You shall not commit murder," and anyone guilty of committing murder would be liable for trial. \f - \fr 5:21 \ft The Greek verb \bd φονευω\bd* literally means "I commit murder." Therefore, murder is specifically in view here.\f*
\p
\v 22 But I tell you that any person who is angry with his brother shall be liable for trial, and anyone who says to his brother, "Airhead!" shall be liable to be brought before the council, but whoever says, "Moron!" shall be liable for the fire of hell. \f - \fr 5:22 \ft The Byzantine family of manuscripts, that form the basis of the \w Textus Receptus\w*, add the word \bd εικη\bd* or \it eiki\it*, which means "without proper cause." But whether Jesus would necessarily recognize such a thing as a good cause to stay angry with someone is an open question.\f*
\p
\v 23 So if you are bringing your gift to the altar, that your brought has something against you,
\p
\v 24 leave your gift in front of the alter, go away, reconcile yourself to your brother first, and then come and offer your gift. \f - \fr 5:24 \ft One does not offer gifts to God while harboring anger in one's heart; such behavior is dishonoring to God and therefore frowned upon.\f*
\p
\v 25 Be on good terms with your adversary quickly, while you are with him on the road; otherwise he might sometime deliver you to the judge, who will deliver you to the bailiff, and you find yourself thrown into prison. \f - \fr 5:25 \ft The Greek word \bd υπηρετης\bd* or \it hyperetis\it* means an attendant; the attendant of a judge would be called a bailiff.\f*
\p
\v 26 I tell you truly: you shall not come out of that prison until you have paid back the last cent. \f - \fr 5:26 \ft The Greek word \bd κοδραντης\bd* referred to the Roman \it quadrans\it*, the smallest coin in the Roman coinage system. The British quarter-penny coin once called a "farthing" was the best equivalent in King James' day.\f* \f - \fr 5:26 \ft \it Alternative view\it*: 'cent' is OK as a translation, just as 'farthing' was in the 17th century. Is a quarter-penny a coin which is still in circulation? 'Paid back the last cent' encompasses the meaning of the text nicely.\f*
\p
\v 27 You have heard that they said, "Do not commit adultery."
\p
\v 28 But I tell you that any man who looks at a woman with desire has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
\p
\v 29 But if your right eye causes you to stumble, take it out and throw it away from you: for it is better for you to have one of your body parts perish than that the whole body be thrown into hell.
\p
\v 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you: for it is better for you to have one of your body parts perish than that the whole body be thrown into hell.
\p
\v 31 It has been said, "Any man who divorces his wife should give her a bill of divorcement."
\p
\v 32 But I say to you that any man who divorces his wife, \it or fails to marry his betrothed\it* for any reason other than improper conduct on her part, causes her to commit adultery; and any person who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. \f - \fr 5:32 \ft In ancient \w Jewish\w* custom, betrothal was as binding as was actual marriage, in the same way that "earnest money contracts" are binding on would-be buyers and sellers of real estate. The only recognized grounds for not "closing the sale," that is, proceeding with the wedding, was improper conduct by the wife before the date of the wedding. Because Matthew, a Jew, was writing to Jews, he included this exception. Luke, who wrote primarily to Gentiles, did not need to, because Gentiles had no such custom as a binding betrothal.\f*
\p
\v 33 Again you have heard that it was said in ancient times, "Do not swear falsely, but keep before the Lord any oath that you do swear."
\p
\v 34 But I tell you: don't swear at all, neither by heaven, the throne of God;
\p
\v 35 nor by the earth, His footstool; nor by \w Jerusalem\w*, the city of the great King,
\p
\v 36 nor by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.
\p
\v 37 But let your word be a simple "Yes" or "No." Anything more than that comes from evil.
\p
\v 38 You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." \f - \fr 5:38 \ft This was the original \it lex talionis\it* and was given to restrain the retaliator from exacting a revenge greater than the original wrong.\f*
\p
\v 39 But I tell you: Don't resist evil. To whomever hits you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him also. \f - \fr 5:39 \ft The Greek "τω πονηρω" can indicate several meanings: The most likely, because of the definite article "τω" is either that it means "the evil one" (a.k.a. Satan), an evil man, or evil in general. The Greek, "μη αντιστηναι" can be taken to mean, "do not resist," which is the most likely of translations given the example of Christ's ultimate sacrifice and also the overarching theme of non-resistance and pacifism that is so prolific in His teachings.\f*
\p
\v 40 And if any person sues you in a court of law, and takes your coat from you, let him have your cloak as well.
\p
\v 41 And if anyone compels you to go a mile with him, go with him two miles. \f - \fr 5:41 \ft A Roman infantryman stationed in the provinces might compel a non-citizen of Rome to carry his backpack for him for one Roman mile, under Roman law and regulation. Jesus urges His followers, in this and other cases, to offer double what another person demands.\f*
\p
\v 42 Give to anyone who asks, and don't turn away from anyone who wants to borrow from you.
\p
\v 43 You have heard that it was said, "Love your neighbor, and disregard your enemy." \f - \fr 5:43 \ft The Greek word \bd μισεω\bd* generally means "I disregard someone." The word connotes not wasting the effort of thought on the other person, rather than cultivating an attitude of anger. Again, Jesus is about to set an even higher standard of human behavior.\f*
\p
\v 44 But I tell you: Love your enemies, bless them who curse you, do good to those who disregard you, and pray for those who treat you spitefully and persecute you, \f - \fr 5:44 \ft Many Greek manuscripts mention only the first and fourth parts of the above, but all four are mutually consistent.\f*
\p
\v 45 so that you may be the children of your Father in heaven. He makes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. \f - \fr 5:45 \ft If God is no Respecter of persons in this regard, then what right have we to impose a sanction that God Himself does not impose?\f*
\p
\v 46 Because if you love them who love you, what reward do you have? Don't even tax collectors do the same thing?
\p
\v 47 And if you exchange polite greetings only with your brothers, what are you doing, any more than others do? Don't even tax-collectors behave this way?
\p
\v 48 You should therefore be perfect, even as your Father Who is in heaven is perfect. \f - \fr 5:48 \ft The word translated "perfect" is the Greek \bd τελειος\bd* or \it teleios\it*, which comes from the root \bd τελε-\bd* meaning far, or at the end. The "perfect person" would be a finished work, having no room for improvement. Jesus necessarily sets the bar high, and encourages His followers to jump as high as they can. But only His substitutionary sacrifice will, in the end, complete the work for anyone.\f*
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Be careful not to perform your acts of charity in front of men, in order to be seen by them; otherwise you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
\p
\v 2 So when you do your duty, do not sound a trumpet before you, the way the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have glory from men. I tell you truly: they will get what's coming to them.
\p
\v 3 But when you give to the poor, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, \f - \fr 6:3 \ft ἐλεημοσύνη: giving to the poor, not a duty...\f*
\p
\v 4 so that your acts of charity may be hidden, and your Father, who sees in a hidden way Himself, will reward you openly.
\p
\v 5 And when you pray, don't be like the hypocrites. They love to pray when standing in the synagogues and in the street corners, so that they may be seen by men. I tell you truly: They will get what's coming to them.
\p
\v 6 But you, when you pray, go into your private room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father Who is hidden, and your Father, who sees in a hidden manner, will reward you openly.
\p
\v 7 And when you do pray, don't use vain repetitions, the way those of other nations do. They think that they'll be heard if they use many words.
\p
\v 8 So don't be like them. Your Father knows what things you need, before you ask Him.
\p
\v 9 Therefore, pray this way: "Our Father, who is in heaven, let your Name be Holy. \f - \fr 6:9 \ft This is \w The Lord's Prayer\w*\f* \f - \fr 6:9 \ft The Greek form \bd αγιασθητω\bd* is in the third-person present imperative or \it jussive\it* form. This is the equivalent of an English jussive subjunctive\f*
\p
\v 10 Let Your kingdom come. Let Your will be done on earth as it is done in heaven. \f - \fr 6:10 \ft Again, the jussive imperative form appears here, not the indicative.\f*
\p
\v 11 Give us our daily bread today. \f - \fr 6:11 \ft In other words: see to our daily needs.\f*
\p
\v 12 And forgive us of all our sins, just as we forgive those who sin against us.
\p
\v 13 And do not lead us into testing, but keep us from the evil one. For yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever.  Amen. \f - \fr 6:13 \ft The Byzantine manuscripts add "For yours is the kingdom," etc. Other manuscripts omit this part.\f*
\p
\v 14 Because if you forgive men the wrongs they do, your heavenly Father will forgive you as well.
\p
\v 15 But if you do not forgive men their wrongdoings, your Father will not forgive your wrongdoings either.
\p
\v 16 Furthermore, when you fast, do not be gloomy, like the hypocrites. They like to disfigure their faces so that they appear to other people to be fasting. I tell you truly: they will get what's coming to them.
\p
\v 17 But you, when you fast, rub your head with oil, and wash your face, \f - \fr 6:17 \ft Anointment, or rubbing of the head with oil, was necessary in desert climates to hold the body water in.\f*
\p
\v 18 so that you do not look like a man fasting to other men, but to your Father Who is hidden, and your Father, who sees in a hidden manner, will reward you openly.
\p
\v 19 Don't store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moths and rust make things unsightly and thieves break through and steal.
\p
\v 20 But store up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where neither moth nor rust can disfigure and no thief can break in or steal.
\p
\v 21 For where your treasure is, your heart will also be.
\p
\v 22 The lamp of the body is the eye. So if your eye is single, then your whole body will be bright.
\p
\v 23 But if your eye is evil, then your whole body will be dark. So if the light that is in you is dark, it is very dark indeed.
\p
\v 24 No one can serve two masters. He will either hate the one and love the other, or else hold to the one and treat the other with contempt. You cannot at the same time be a slave to God and wealth.
\p
\v 25 For this reason I tell you: stop worrying about your life, and what you will eat [or drink], or for your body, or what you will wear. Isn't life more than about food, and the body more than about clothes? \f - \fr 6:25 \ft The Greek verb is a negation of a present imperative. Such a construct tells the reader to stop doing something that he is presently doing or in the habit of doing.\f*
\p
\v 26 Look at the birds in the sky. They neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren't you much better than they are?
\p
\v 27 Who among you, by worrying about it, can add one foot to his height?
\p
\v 28 And why do you worry about your clothes? Look at the lilies of the field, and how they grow. They don't work or spin.
\p
\v 29 And yet I tell you that even \w Solomon\w* in all his glory was never clothed like one of these.
\p
\v 30 So if God can thus clothe the grass of the field, which is here today and thrown into the oven tomorrow, will he not clothe you so much more, you who have so little faith?
\p
\v 31 So stop worrying, and saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
\p
\v 32 For the Gentiles seek after all these things, but your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
\p
\v 33 But first seek after the Kingdom of God, and His justice, and every one of these things will be added to you.
\p
\v 34 So stop worrying about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. The bad things that happen today are enough to worry about today.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Stop judging others, if you do not want to be judged.
\p
\v 2 For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged, and with whatever measure you measure out to others, it will be measured to you.
\p
\v 3 And why do you behold the mote in your brother's eye, and not consider the beam in your own eye?
\p
\v 4 Or how can you say to your brother, "Let me take the mote out of your eye", while a beam is in your own eye?
\p
\v 5 Hypocrite! Throw the beam out of your own eye first, and then you will see clearly to throw out the mote in your brother's eye.
\p
\v 6 Stop giving holy things to the dogs, and throwing your pearls in front of pigs, if you don't want them to trample them underfoot, and turn against you and tear you apart.
\p
\v 7 Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
\p
\v 8 For everyone who asks, receives; he who seeks, finds; and to him who knocks, it is opened.
\p
\v 9 Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
\p
\v 10 Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?
\p
\v 11 If you, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him?
\p
\v 12 So however you would want men to treat you, treat them the same way. The law and the prophets require this.
\p
\v 13 Enter in at the narrow gate. The gate is wide, and the road broad, that leads to destruction, and many people go in that way,
\p
\v 14 because the gate and the road that lead to life are narrow, and few people find it.
\p
\v 15 Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
\p
\v 16 You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
\p
\v 17 In fact every good tree makes good fruit, but a corrupt tree makes bad fruit.
\p
\v 18 A good tree cannot make bad fruit, nor a corrupt tree make good fruit.
\p
\v 19 Every tree that does not make good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
\p
\v 20 Therefore, by their fruits you will know them.
\p
\v 21 Not everyone who says to me, "Lord! Lord!" will enter into the Kingdom of heaven, but rather the one who does the will of My Father in heaven (will so enter).
\p
\v 22 Many people will say to me in that day, "Lord! Lord! Haven't we told of the future in Your Name? Haven't we thrown demons out of people in Your Name? Haven't we done wonderful works in Your Name?"
\p
\v 23 And then I will tell them plainly: "I never knew you. Get away from me, you who work lawlessness."
\p
\v 24 So everyone who hears these things that I say, and does them, I will compare to a wise man, who built his house on a rock,
\p
\v 25 and the rain came down, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house, and it did not fall, because it was founded on rock.
\p
\v 26 And everyone who hears these things that I say, and does not do them, will be compared to a foolish man, who built his house on sand,
\p
\v 27 and the rain came down, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house, and it fell, and fell with a great crash.
\p
\v 28 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished talking, that the crowds were amazed at His teaching,
\p
\v 29 because when He taught them He spoke with and from authority, and not in the way the scribes commonly taught them.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 When He had come down from the mountain, great crowds of people followed Him.
\p
\v 2 And then a leper came and fell down at His feet, saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean."
\p
\v 3 And He put out his hand, and touched him, and said, "I am willing. Be clean." And immediately the man's \w leprosy\w* was cleansed. \f - \fr 8:3 \ft The \w leprosy\w* in view here could be any of a number of contagious skin disorders common to the Middle East in that time, and not necessarily \w Hansen's Disease\w* caused by \it Mycobacterium leprae\it*.\f*
\p
\v 4 And Jesus told him, "Don't breathe a word of this to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded as a testimony to them." \f - \fr 8:4 \ft Someone might occasionally find himself free of the particular skin disorder that fell under the general heading of "leprosy." Such a man was always supposed to offer a sacrificial animal to give thanks to God.\f*
\p
\v 5 And when Jesus had gone into Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, begging Him, \f - \fr 8:5 \ft A Roman centurion (\w Greek\w* \bd ἑκατοντάρχης\bd*, literally, "leader of a hundred") was the lowest-ranking commissioned officer in the Roman army. He commanded a century of troops, consisting typically of eighty fighting men and twenty auxiliaries.\f*
\p
\v 6 and saying, "Lord, my servant is bedridden in my house, paralyzed and in great pain."
\p
\v 7 And Jesus told him, "I will come and heal him."
\p
\v 8 In answer, the centurion said, "Lord, I don't deserve to have you come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
\p
\v 9 "For I am part of a chain of command, and I have soldiers under my command. I tell this man, "Go" and he goes, and another, "Come" and he comes, and my servant, "Do this," and he does it."
\p
\v 10 When Jesus heard that, he was amazed, and said to those that were following him, "I tell you truly, I have not found such great faith, even in \w Israel\w*.
\p
\v 11 "And I tell you that many will come from east and west, and will sit down with \w Abraham\w*, and \w Isaac\w*, and \w Jacob\w*, in the Kingdom of heaven.
\p
\v 12 "But the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into outer darkness; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth."
\p
\v 13 And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, and as you have believed, so let it be done for you." And his servant was healed in that very hour.
\p
\v 14 And when Jesus had come into Peter's house, He saw his wife's mother, bedridden and ill with fever.
\p
\v 15 And He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and waited on them.
\p
\v 16 That evening, they brought to Him many that were demon-oppressed, and He threw out the spirits with His word, and healed all the sick people,
\p
\v 17 so that this might be fulfilled that was spoken by \w Isaiah\w* the prophet, who said, "He Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses."
\p
\v 18 Now when Jesus saw great crowds of people around him, He gave orders to leave for the other side.
\p
\v 19 And a certain scribe came, and told Him, "Master, I will follow you wherever you go."
\p
\v 20 And Jesus told him, "\w Foxes\w* have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of man has no place to rest His head."
\p
\v 21 And another of His pupils said to him, "Lord, first permit me to go to bury my father."
\p
\v 22 But Jesus told him, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own."
\p
\v 23 And when He had gone into a boat, His pupils followed Him. \f - \fr 8:23 \ft This was a small fishing sloop, probably not more than fifteen feet from stem to stern.\f*
\p
\v 24 And behold, a great storm arose on the lake, so much that the boat was swamped with the waves. But He was asleep.
\p
\v 25 And His pupils came to Him, and woke Him up, saying, "Lord, save us; we're dying!"
\p
\v 26 And He said to them, "Why are you afraid, you of little faith?" Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm fell. \f - \fr 8:26 \ft Perhaps "... and watched the winds and the sea such that their chaotic turmoil ended."  See \w Essay:Calming the Storm\w*.\f*
\p
\v 27 But the men were amazed, saying, "What kind of Man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey Him!"
\p
\v 28 And when He had come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met Him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no man dared pass by that way. \f - \fr 8:28 \ft The Byzantine family renders this "Gergesenes." In fact, this was Gadite country, and so "Gadarene" is proper.\f*
\p
\v 29 And suddenly they cried out, saying, "What business do we have with You, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?" \f - \fr 8:29 \ft All demons know that God will deal definitively with them eventually, and still they demand more time, as if they can possibly escape the judgment that will come to them.\f*
\p
\v 30 And a herd of many pigs was feeding a fair distance from them.
\p
\v 31 So the demons begged Him, saying, "If you're going to throw us out, let us go away into the herd of pigs."
\p
\v 32 And He said to them, "Go." And when they came out of the two men, they went into the herd of pigs. And the entire herd of pigs ran pell-mell down a steep bank into the sea, and drowned in the waters.
\p
\v 33 And those who had been keeping the pigs ran away, and went back into the city, and told about everything that had happened, and what had happened to the formerly demon-possessed men.
\p
\v 34 And then the entire city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw Him, they begged Him to go away from their coasts.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 And He boarded a boat, and crossed the lake, and came into His own city.
\p
\v 2 And they brought to Him a paralyzed man, lying on a pallet. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Son, cheer up; your sins are forgiven you."
\p
\v 3 And some of the scribes said among themselves, "This man is speaking blasphemy."
\p
\v 4 And Jesus, Who knew what they were thinking, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?
\p
\v 5 "For which would be easier to say: 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or 'Get up and walk'?
\p
\v 6 "But so that you may know that the Son of man has the authority on earth to forgive sins..." Then He said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take up your pallet, and go to your house."
\p
\v 7 And he got up and went away to his house.
\p
\v 8 But when the crowds saw it, they were very much afraid, and gave glory to God, Who had given power like that to men. \f - \fr 9:8 \ft The Byzantine family has the verb \bd θαυμαζω\bd*, which means, "I make someone say, 'Wow!'" But the best manuscripts say that the people in those crowds were afraid, not merely impressed with an amazing spectacle.\f*
\p
\v 9 And as Jesus walked away from that place, He saw a man, Matthew by name, sitting in the tax office, and He said to him, "Follow Me." And he got up and followed Him.
\p
\v 10 And it came to pass, as He reclined to dine in the house, many tax-gatherers and sinners came and reclined with Him and His pupils. \f - \fr 9:10 \ft Men in those days did not \it sit\it* down at the dinnertable; they \it lay\it* down on couches set alongside the table, held themselves up on one elbow, and reached for their food.\f*
\p
\v 11 And when the \w Pharisees\w* saw this, they said to His pupils, "Why is your Master eating with tax-gatherers and sinners?" \f - \fr 9:11 \ft \w Pharisees\w* constantly held themselves "holier than" the rest of their society. Tax-gatherers were the lowest of the low in Jewish society, primarily on account of the methods they employed. They were not direct government employees, but were private collection agents, to whom the Romans "farmed out" the tax-collection task. This "farming-out" caused great controversy even in the Senate of Rome and was one of the sorest points of anti-Roman resentment among the Jews.\f*
\p
\v 12 But when Jesus heard that, He told them, "The well do not need to see the doctor, but the sick do.
\p
\v 13 "But you go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.' For I haven't come here to call the just, but sinners to change their hearts."
\p
\v 14 Then some followers of John the Baptist came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your students do not fast?"
\p
\v 15 And Jesus told them, "Can the members of the wedding party mourn, so long as the groom is with them? But a time will come when the groom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.
\p
\v 16 "No man puts a piece of new cloth onto an old garment. What is put in to fill the tear takes something from the old garment, and the hole is torn even wider.
\p
\v 17 Neither do men put freshly-squeezed grape juice into old skins; otherwise the skins break, the juice runs out, and the skins are ruined. Instead they put fresh juice into new skins, and both are preserved. \f - \fr 9:17 \ft The \w Greek\w* word \bd οινος\bd* means simply "the fruit of the vine." Wine in the modern sense of an \w alcoholic drink\w* was not a common drink, especially among the Jews. Contrary to popular belief, connoisseurs of grape juice actively sought to stop it from fermenting and in fact had five different methods available to them to accomplish this.  See, e.g., "Oinos: a discussion of the Bible wine question," by Leon C. Field (1883).\f*
\p
\v 18 While He was speaking these things to them, behold, a certain ruler came to Him, and fell down at His feet, saying, "My daughter is dead even now. But come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live."
\p
\v 19 And Jesus got up and followed him, and so did His students.
\p
\v 20 And behold, a woman, who had been hemorrhaging for twelve years, came behind Him, and touched the hem of His robe.
\p
\v 21 For she said to herself, "If I could just touch His robe, I will be made well."
\p
\v 22 But Jesus turned around, and when He saw her, He said, "Daughter, take heart; your faith has made you well." And the woman was made well from that hour.
\p
\v 23 And when Jesus came to the ruler's house, and saw the \w musicians\w* and the crowds making a scene,
\p
\v 24 He told them, "Give Me room. This young woman is not dead; she is asleep." And they laughed at Him scornfully.
\p
\v 25 But when the crowds were put outside, He went in, and took her by the hand, and the young woman got up.
\p
\v 26 And the news of this event went out into that entire land.
\p
\v 27 And when Jesus went away from that place, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
\p
\v 28 And when he had come into the house, the blind men came to Him. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I can do this?" They said to Him, "Yes, Lord."
\p
\v 29 Then He touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith, let it work out for you."
\p
\v 30 And their eyes were opened, and Jesus gave them strict orders, saying, "Don't let any man know anything about this."
\p
\v 31 But they, when they had left, spread the news of him in that entire country.
\p
\v 32 As they went out, some people brought to him a mute demon-possessed man.
\p
\v 33 And when the demon was thrown out, the mute spoke. The crowds said, "Wow! Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!"
\p
\v 34 But the Pharisees said, "He throws out demons by calling upon the leader of demons."
\p
\v 35 And Jesus went around to all the cities and towns, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
\p
\v 36 But when He saw the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were worried, and were scattered about like sheep without a shepherd.
\p
\v 37 Then He said to His students, "The harvest is truly bountiful, but the harvesters are few.
\p
\v 38 So pray to the Lord of the harvest, that He will send out workmen to gather in His harvest.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 And when He had summoned His twelve  students, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could throw them out of a person, and to heal every kind of chronic illness and every kind of germ. \f - \fr 10:1 \ft The Greek phrase \bd πνευματοι ακαθαρτοι\bd* literally translates as "unclean spirits." "Unclean" here means "having no possible relationship to God," because God cannot tolerate uncleanness in His Presence.\f* \f - \fr 10:1 \ft Two words appear in Greek, and often together, to describe human physical conditions that fall under the category of "sickness" or "illness." One is \bd μαλακια\bd* (\it malakia\it*) and the other is \bd νοσος\bd* (\it nosos\it*). Why the Greeks had two different concepts of sickness is difficult to determine, but perhaps \bd μαλακια\bd* stood for a chronic condition, like \w cancer\w*, and \bd νοσος\bd* for any condition caused by a germ, like \w influenza\w*.\f*
\p
\v 2 Now the names of the twelve Apostles are as follows:
\li1 1. Simon, called Peter
\li1 2. Andrew, his brother
\li1 3. James son of Zebedee
\li1 4. John, his brother \f - \fr 10:2 \ft The Greek word \bd αποστολος\bd* \it apostolos\it* comes from the verb \bd αποστελλω\bd* \it apostello\it*, which means "I send out on a mission." These were the first-ever missionaries.\f*
\li1
\v 3 5. Philip
\li1 6. Bartholomew
\li1 7. Thomas
\li1 8. Matthew the tax gatherer
\li1 9. James son of Alpheus
\li1 10. Thaddeus\f - \fr 10:3 \ft The Thomas mentioned here is the one called "Doubting" today. The Matthew is the same man whom Jesus recruited out of his tax office, and the author of this Book of the Bible.\f* \f - \fr 10:3 \ft The Byzantine family calls Thaddeus "Lebbeus, surnamed Thaddeus"\f*
\li1
\v 4 11. Simon the Canaanite
\li1 12. Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him later on.
\p
\v 5 Jesus sent these Twelve out with this instruction: "Do not take the road leading to the Gentiles, nor enter into any Samaritan town. \f - \fr 10:5 \ft The Samaritans were descendants of various populations transplanted into the old \w Kingdom of Israel\w* by \w Shalmaneser V\w* after he had finished conquering it. These Samaritans were even lower than tax-gatherers in Pharisaical estimation.\f*
\p
\v 6 "Instead, go to the lost sheep of the house of \w Israel\w*.
\p
\v 7 "And as you go, preach, saying, 'The Kingdom of heaven is near.' \f - \fr 10:7 \ft The verb used is the perfect tense of a verb meaning "I approach." Thus it means that the Kingdom is in a state of being near, after having come near.\f*
\p
\v 8 "Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, throw out demons. You have received freely, so give freely.
\p
\v 9 "Do not provide either \w gold\w*, \w silver\w*, or \w bronze\w* in your money belts, \f - \fr 10:9 \ft \w Brass\w*, an alloy of \w copper\w* and \w zinc\w*, was unknown in Biblical times. The metal actually meant by the Greek word \bd χαλκος\bd* or \it chalcos\it* is \w bronze\w*, an alloy of copper and \w tin\w*. Bronze was the least valuable of all the precious metals normally used as media of exchange. (Today it is the least precious of the metals used to make Olympic medals.) In fact, \it chalcos\it* often meant "small change."\f*
\p
\v 10 "nor paper money for your journey, nor two coats, nor shoes, nor even walking sticks. The workman earns his wages.
\p
\v 11 "Into any city or village that you enter, inquire who in it is deserving, and stay with that person until you leave that place.
\p
\v 12 "When you come into a house, greet it properly.
\p
\v 13 "And if the house is a deserving house, let your peace come on it, but if it doesn't deserve it, then let your peace come back to you.
\p
\v 14 "And whoever refuses to receive you or hear your words, when you walk out of that house or city, shake the dust off your feet. \f - \fr 10:14 \ft This was a formal gesture of contempt that involved taking off the shoes and clapping them together to knock the dust off.\f*
\p
\v 15 "I tell you truly: it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of the Trial, than for that city.
\p
\v 16 "I am sending you out like sheep in the middle of a pack of wolves. So be as cunning as \w snakes\w* and as innocent as \w doves\w*.
\p
\v 17 "And watch out for the people. They are likely to hand you over to the Sanhedrin and have you scourged in their synagogues; \f - \fr 10:17 \ft The \w Sanhedrin\w* was the ruling council among the Jews. The \w High Priest\w* served as its chairman. Recent reports indicate that the worldwide Orthodox Jewish community is now trying to reinstate the Sanhedrin after centuries of its absence.\f*
\p
\v 18 "and you will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony against them and against the Gentiles. \f - \fr 10:18 \ft The Greek word \bd ηγεμον\bd* (\it hegemon\it*) was the common word used to describe a ranking magistrate in any Roman province. Such an officer typically carried such titles as proconsul, propraetor, or procurator, depending on whether the magistrate held the same rank as a consul, praetor, or \it aedilus curulis\it* in the city of \w Rome\w*.\f* \f - \fr 10:18 \ft The "kings" in view here are client-kings, or "puppet kings," of the Roman Empire. They were hardly sovereign, but answered to the Roman Emperor.\f*
\p
\v 19 "But when they so arraign you, don't worry about how or what to say. In that very moment it will be given you what to say.
\p
\v 20 "Because it won't be you doing the speaking, but the Guide (Spirit) from your Father speaking from within you.
\p
\v 21 "Brother shall turn in brother for execution, and father will turn in child, and children will rise up against their parents and have them executed.
\p
\v 22 "And you will be hated by all men on account of My Name. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
\p
\v 23 "But when people persecute you in one city, flee to another city. I tell you truly: you will not have finished visiting all the cities in Israel until the Son, a human being, has come.
\p
\v 24 "The student is not above his teacher, nor the slave above his lord.
\p
\v 25 "It is enough that the student be like his teacher, and the slave like his lord. If they have called the master of the house the Lord of the Flies, how much more will they call the members of the household? \f - \fr 10:25 \ft The name \w Beelzebub\w*, first mentioned in \w 2_Kings 1:3\w* , translates literally as "Lord of the Flies." Most scholars identify this personage as another name for \w Satan\w*.\f*
\p
\v 26 "So don't be afraid of them. Nothing is covered that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be made known.
\p
\v 27 "What I tell you in darkness, speak in the light, and what you hear in the ear, shout from the housetops.
\p
\v 28 "And don't be afraid of those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the One Who can destroy both body and soul in hell.
\p
\v 29 "Aren't two \w sparrows\w* sold for a penny? And neither one will fall to the ground without your Father knowing about it. \f - \fr 10:29 \ft The "penny" mentioned here is the \bd ασσαριον\bd* or \it assarion\it*, the second-least-valuable Roman coin. One \it assarion\it* was worth four \it quadrantes\it*. (See Matthew 5:26) Thus it was worth more than a farthing and was in fact worth about as much as a British penny in King James' day.\f*
\p
\v 30 "In fact the very hairs on your head are all counted.
\p
\v 31 "So don't be afraid; you are more valuable than many sparrows.
\p
\v 32 "So every person who speaks out about Me in front of men, I will also speak out about in front of My Father in heaven.
\p
\v 33 "But if anyone denies me before men, I will deny him before My Father in heaven.
\p
\v 34 "Don't think that I came to send peace on earth. I did not come to send peace, but a sword. \f - \fr 10:34 \ft The sword (Greek \bd μαχαιρα\bd*) mentioned here is a Roman infantryman's sidearm.\f*
\p
\v 35 "I came to set 'man against father, and daughter against mother, and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.
\p
\v 36 "'And a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.'
\p
\v 37 "A man who loves father or mother more than Me doesn't deserve Me, and a man who loves son or daughter more than Me doesn't deserve Me.
\p
\v 38 "And whoever will not take his cross, and follow after Me, doesn't deserve Me. \f - \fr 10:38 \ft The expression "to take one's cross" signifies two things: To commit oneself totally to Christ with no turning back, to be willing to die on His account, if necessary.\f*
\p
\v 39 "He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.
\p
\v 40 "The one that receives you, receives Me, and the one who receives Me, receives Him Who sent Me.
\p
\v 41 "One who receives a prophet in a prophet's name will receive a prophet's reward, and one who receives a just man in a just man's name will receive a just man's reward.
\p
\v 42 "And whoever gives one of these little ones a cup of cold water to drink, even if only in the name of a student (of Mine), I tell you truly: he will not lose his reward under any circumstances." \f - \fr 10:42 \ft \f*
\c 11
\p
\v 1 "And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished giving His orders to His twelve prize students, He left that place in order to teach and preach in their cities.
\p
\v 2 Now when \w John the Baptist\w*, who was in prison, heard about the works of Christ, he sent a message to Christ, carried by his own students. \f - \fr 11:2 \ft The Byzantine manuscripts say that John sent \bd two\bd* students of his, specifically. However, that might possibly be a copyist's error. Most manuscripts have the preposition \bd δια\bd*, meaning "through", but the Byzantine manuscripts have \bd δυο\bd*, or the number two.\f*
\p
\v 3 The message asked: "Are you the one we were led to expect to come, or shall we wait for someone else?"
\p
\v 4 In answer, Jesus told John's messengers, "Go and show John again what you can hear and see:
\p
\v 5 "The blind see again, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the Good News preached to them.
\p
\v 6 "And anyone who does not have doubts about Me will be blessed."
\p
\v 7 And as they were leaving, Jesus began to say to the crowds about John, "What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed shaken in the wind?
\p
\v 8 "And what did you go out to see? A man wearing soft clothes? You'll find people wearing soft clothes in kings' houses.
\p
\v 9 "And what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
\p
\v 10 "This is the one of whom Scripture says, 'Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, and he will prepare Your road before You.'
\p
\v 11 "I tell you truly: Among those who are born from women, there has never been a greater man than John the Baptist, even though the least person in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.
\p
\v 12 "And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers from violence, and the violent people snatch it by force.
\p
\v 13 "Because all the prophets and the law used to prophesy until John came.
\p
\v 14 "And if you are willing to take it, this is \w Elijah\w*, who said he'd come back.
\p
\v 15 "Let anyone hear if he has ears to hear.
\p
\v 16 "But to what shall I compare this generation? It's like several children sitting in the public squares, and calling to their fellows,
\p
\v 17 "And saying, 'We have blown the pipes for you, and you did not dance, and we have mourned to you, and you have not lamented.'
\p
\v 18 "Because John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He's demon-possessed.'
\p
\v 19 "The Son, a human being, came eating and drinking, and they say, 'He's a glutton and a wine drinker, and a friend of tax-gatherers and sinners.' But wisdom is justified by her works." \f - \fr 11:19 \ft The Byzantine manuscript family has "children" rather than "works."\f* \f - \fr 11:19 \ft The expression "wine-drinker" does not connote \w alcoholic drink\w* intoxication, but rather the taking of expensive (for the time) foodstuffs to excess. The larger principle is that Jesus makes an excellent case that He "cannot win for losing" in the eyes of His critics.\f*
\p
\v 20 Then He started denouncing the cities in which most of His mighty works had been done, because the people in those cities never changed their hearts and minds:
\p
\v 21 "It will go horribly for you, Chorazin! And you, Bethsaida! If the mighty works that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have changed their hearts long ago and put on sackcloth and ashes.
\p
\v 22 "But I say to you that it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the Day of Trial, than for you.
\p
\v 23 "And you, Capernaum, that are exalted to the sky, will be brought down to the underworld! If the mighty works that have been done in you had been done in Sodom, that city would still be standing.
\p
\v 24 "But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the Day of Trial than for you."
\p
\v 25 In that time Jesus said in answer, "Father, I thank You, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the sophisticated and clever, and have revealed them to the uneducated." \f - \fr 11:25 \ft "sophisticated" is more precise than "wise"; "clever" more precise than "prudent"; and "uneducated" more precise than "babes"\f*
\p
\v 26 "Yes, Father, because it seemed good in Your estimation.
\p
\v 27 "All things are delivered to Me by My Father, and no man knows the Son except the Father, and neither does any man know the Father, except the Son, and the one to whom the Son will reveal Him.
\p
\v 28 "Come to Me, all of you who work hard and carry a heavy load. I will give you rest.
\p
\v 29 "Take My yoke on yourself, and learn from Me. I am gentle and humble in heart. And you will find rest for your souls. \f - \fr 11:29 \ft The yoke is a framework for fastening two beasts of burden, typically \w oxen\w*, to work as a team. Jesus does not propose to lay another burden on people, but offers to work in tandem with us to help carry our loads, if we will but let Him.\f*
\p
\v 30 "My yoke is easy to carry, and My load is light."
\c 12
\p
\v 1 At that time Jesus went through a \w cornfield\w* on a Sabbath day. His students were hungry and started to pull out ears of corn from the stalks and eat them.
\p
\v 2 And when the Pharisees saw them doing this, they told him, "Stop! Your students are doing things that are against Sabbath regulations!" \f - \fr 12:2 \ft The Greek expression \bd εξεστι(ν)\bd* or \it exesti(n)\it* means "it is lawful," or can also mean "it is according to regulations." The Pharisees had taken upon themselves to write a very large body of regulations governing conduct on the Sabbath day, not one of which was found in the \w Old Testament\w*.\f*
\p
\v 3 But He told them, "Haven't you read what \w David\w* did, when he was hungry, and so were those who were with him,
\p
\v 4 "how he went into the \w Tabernacle\w* and ate \w showbread\w*, which was not proper for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? \f - \fr 12:4 \ft See the story of \w High Priest\w* \w Ahimelech I\w* for details. (\w 1_Samuel 21:1-9\w* (NASB))\f*
\p
\v 5 "Or haven't you read in the law, that on Sabbath days the priests in the \w Temple\w* usually do things that desecrate the Sabbath and are held harmless for it?
\p
\v 6 "But I am telling you that right here you have Someone greater than the Temple.
\p
\v 7 "But if you had known what 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice' means, you wouldn't have condemned someone who had done nothing wrong.
\p
\v 8 "Because the Son, a human being, is Lord even of the Sabbath."
\p
\v 9 And when He had left that place, He went into their synagogue.
\p
\v 10 A man was present who had a withered hand. And they asked Him a question, "Is it lawful to heal on Sabbath days?" so that they might accuse him. \f - \fr 12:10 \ft In this case, the Pharisees sought to accuse him&#8212;again&#8212;of breaking their extra-Biblical regulations.\f*
\p
\v 11 And He told them, "Is there anyone among you who, if he has one sheep, and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, will not take hold of it and lift it out?" \f - \fr 12:11 \ft Such was the full implication of the Pharisaical sabbath regulations that the slightest effort was regarded as "working on the Sabbath," in violation of the Fourth Commandment.\f*
\p
\v 12 "So how much better is a man than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to behave well on Sabbath days."
\p
\v 13 Then He told the man, "Hold out your hand." And he held it out, and it was restored and made well, like the other hand.
\p
\v 14 Then the Pharisees left, and held a council against Him, to determine how to destroy Him.
\p
\v 15 And when Jesus knew about that, He left that place, and great crowds followed Him, and He healed them all,
\p
\v 16 and gave them orders not to make Him famous in any way,
\p
\v 17 so that this might be fulfilled, spoken by \w Isaiah\w*, who said,
\p
\v 18 "Look at My Servant, Whom I have chosen, My Beloved, in Whom My Soul is well pleased. I will put My Spirit on Him, and He will show judgment to the nations.
\p
\v 19 "He will not struggle, nor cry, and neither will any man hear His voice in the streets.
\p
\v 20 "He will not break even a bruised reed, and will not quench smoking flax, until He causes justice to triumph,
\p
\v 21 "And the nations will trust in His Name."
\p
\v 22 Then they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute. He healed him, so that this blind and mute man could see and speak.
\p
\v 23 Everyone in the crowds were amazed, and said, "Isn't this Man the Son of David?"
\p
\v 24 But when the Pharisees heard about it, they said, "This Man throws out demons by calling on \w Beelzebub\w*, the ruler of the demons."
\p
\v 25 But Jesus knew what they were thinking, and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate like a desert, and every city or house divided against itself cannot stand. \f - \fr 12:25 \ft Jesus now proceeds to illustrate the utter lack of \w logic\w* of the Pharisees' position.\f*
\p
\v 26 "So if Satan throws out Satan, he is divided against himself. So how can his kingdom stand?
\p
\v 27 "And if I throw out demons by calling on Beelzebub, by whom do your children throw them out? They will be your judges on this account.
\p
\v 28 "But if I throw out demons by using the Divine Guide of God, then the Kingdom of God has come to you.
\p
\v 29 "Or else how can anyone walk into a strong man's house, and steal his goods, without first restraining the strong man? Then he can ransack his house."
\p
\v 30 "Whoever is not with Me is against Me, and whoever does not gather with Me, scatters about.
\p
\v 31 "For this reason I am telling you: All sorts of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to men. But blasphemy against the Divine Guide will not be forgiven to men.
\p
\v 32 "Any person who speaks a word against the Son, a human being, will have that word forgiven him. But any person who speaks against the Divine Guide will not have that speech forgiven him, not in this world, and not in the world to come."
\p
\v 33 "Either make the tree good, and its fruit will be good, or else make the tree rotten, and its fruit will be rotten. The tree is known by its fruit.
\p
\v 34 "You jerks, how can you, being evil, say anything good? The mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart. \f - \fr 12:34 \ft See Matthew 3:7. Jesus uses the same expression that \w John the Baptist\w* once used.\f*
\p
\v 35 "A good man, out of a good (heart) treasure, produces good things; a bad man, out of a bad (heart) treasure, produces bad things.
\p
\v 36 "And I am telling you: Every idle word that men speak, they will have to explain in the Day of Trial.
\p
\v 37 "Because you will be justified by your words, and condemned by your words."
\p
\v 38 Then some of the scribes and the Pharisees said in answer, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you." \f - \fr 12:38 \ft This was a consistent demand from the Pharisees and indeed all the Jews. Now Jesus shows that even Divine Patience has Its limits.\f*
\p
\v 39 And He in answer told them, "A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign, and they're not going to get one, except the sign of the prophet \w Jonah\w*.
\p
\v 40 "Just as 'Jonah spent three days and nights in the belly of a sea-monster,' so also the Son, a human being, will spend three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. \f - \fr 12:40 \ft See \w Jonah 2\w* . The Greek word \bd κητος\bd* (\it ketos\it*), from which comes the Latin word \it cetus\it*, originally meant any large creature of the sea. Modern man gave that name to the family \w Cetaceae\w*, the family of the great \w whales\w*. This did not mean that Jonah's creature was necessarily a great whale.\f*
\p
\v 41 "The men of \w Nineveh\w* will rise at the Trial along with this generation, and will condemn it, because they changed their hearts at the preaching of Jonah, and a greater man than Jonah is now present. \f - \fr 12:41 \ft See \w Jonah 3\w*  for details.\f*
\p
\v 42 "The queen of the south will rise up at the trial along with this generation, and will condemn it, because she came from the furthest reaches of the earth to hear the wisdom of \w Solomon\w*. A much greater man than Solomon is now present." \f - \fr 12:42 \ft This refers to the visit paid to King Solomon by the Queen of Sheba.\f*
\p
\v 43 "When the unclean spirit has left a man, he walks through dry places, looking for rest, and does not find it.
\p
\v 44 "Then he says, 'I will go back to the house from which I came.' And when he comes back, he finds the house unoccupied, swept clean, and put in order.
\p
\v 45 "Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than he, and they come in and settle there, and the last state of that man is worse than the first. And that's how it's going to be as well for this wicked generation."
\p
\v 46 While He was still talking to the people, His mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak with Him.
\p
\v 47 And someone told him, "Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, and want to speak with You."
\p
\v 48 But in answer He said back to the person who told Him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
\p
\v 49 And He held out His hand toward His students, and said, "They are My mother and brothers!
\p
\v 50 "Because any person who does what My Father in Heaven wants, that person is My brother, and sister, and mother."
\c 13
\p
\v 1 On that day Jesus left the house and sat by the lake. \f - \fr 13:1 \ft trimmed a bit with more familiar language\f*
\p
\v 2 Great crowds gathered for Him. So he boarded a boat and sat there, while the entire crowd stood on the shore. \f - \fr 13:2 \ft The acoustics of Lake Tiberias do allow this sort of activity at many points.\f*
\p
\v 3 He taught much to them in parables, saying, "Consider this: A sower went out to sow seed.
\p
\v 4 And when he sowed, some of the seeds fell on the roadside, and birds came and ate them up.
\p
\v 5 Other seeds fell on rock, where there was little soil. They sprouted immediately, because the soil was not deep,
\p
\v 6 and by midday the sun scorched them, and because they lacked roots, they withered.
\p
\v 7 "Others fell among thorns. The thorns sprang up, and choked them.
\p
\v 8 "But still others fell on good ground, and produced fruit, some a hundred times as much, some sixty times as much, and some thirty times as much.
\p
\v 9 "Anyone having ears to hear, let him hear."
\p
\v 10 And His students came and said to Him, "Why do You speak to them in parables?"
\p
\v 11 In answer He told them, "I speak in parables because it is granted to you to know the secrets of the Kingdom of heaven, but it is not granted to them.
\p
\v 12 "For whoever has, it will be given to him even more abundantly. But whoever has not, even what he has will be taken away from him.
\p
\v 13 "That's why I talk to them in parables: because they see without seeing, and hear without hearing, and don't understand, either.
\p
\v 14 "In them the prophecy of \w Isaiah\w* is fulfilled. That prophecy says: 'By hearing you will hear, and not understand, and seeing you will see, and not perceive.
\p
\v 15 "'Because the heart of this people has grown fat, and their ears are dull of hearing, and they have shut their eyes; otherwise they might at any time see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and would be converted, and I would heal them.'
\p
\v 16 "But your eyes are blessed, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.
\p
\v 17 For I tell you truly: Many prophets and just men have strongly desired to see the things that you see, and have not seen them, and to hear the things that you hear, and have not heard them.
\p
\v 18 "So listen to the parable of the sower:
\p
\v 19 "When anyone hears the Truth about the Kingdom, and fails to understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away whatever was sown in his heart. This is the one who receives the seed that fell by the roadside. \f - \fr 13:19 \ft The "evil one" mentioned here is \w Satan\w*.\f*
\p
\v 20 "And he who receives the seed in rocky places, is the one who hears the Truth, and receives it with joy,
\p
\v 21 "but has no root in himself. He will last a little while, and then when oppression or persecution arises on account of the Truth, he finally stumbles and falls away.
\p
\v 22 "Also, he who receives the seed among the thorns is one who hears the Truth, and the worries of this world, and the deception that comes with wealth, choke the Truth, and he he becomes unfruitful.
\p
\v 23 But he who receives seed on good ground is the one who hears the Truth, understands it, and also bears fruit, and produces a hundred, or sixty, or thirty times as much as he received.
\p
\v 24 He told them another parable: "The Kingdom of heaven islike a man who sowed good seed in his field.
\p
\v 25 "But while everyone was asleep, his enemy came and sowed weeds in the middle of the wheat, and then left. \f - \fr 13:25 \ft The Greek word \bd ζιζανιον\bd* or \it zizanion\it* is the word used for a specific weed that closely resembles wheat.\f*
\p
\v 26 "And when the blades of wheat sprouted, and produced their grain, the weeds appeared as well.
\p
\v 27 "So the household slaves came and told him, 'Lord, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did these weeds come from?'
\p
\v 28 "He told them, 'An enemy has done this.' The slaves asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'
\p
\v 29 "And he said, 'No. If you pull the weeds, you might pull up the wheat along with them.
\p
\v 30 "'Let them both grow together until the harvest. At harvest time I will tell the harvesters, "Gather the weeds together first, and tie them in bundles to burn them, and gather the wheat into my barn."'"
\p
\v 31 He told them another parable: "The Kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, that a man took and sowed in his field.
\p
\v 32 "Mustard is the smallest of all seeds. But when it grows, it is the largest among herbs, and grows into a tree, so that birds of the sky can come and nest in its branches."
\p
\v 33 He spoke another parable to them: "The Kingdom of heaven is like yeast, that a woman took and hid in three \it sata\it* of meal, until the entire loaf was filled with it." \f - \fr 13:33 \ft A \it saton\it* is equivalent to 21.6 dry pints.\f*
\p
\v 34 Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables, and did not speak to them other than in parables,
\p
\v 35 so that the prophecy (by Isaiah) might be fulfilled. That prophecy states: "I will open My mouth in parables. I will talk about things that have been kept hidden from the foundation of the world."
\p
\v 36 Then Jesus sent the crowd away, and went into the house. His students came to him, saying, "Explain the parable of the weeds in the field to us."
\p
\v 37 In answer He told them, "The one sowing the good seed is the Son, a human being.
\p
\v 38 "The field is the world. The good seed are the recognized children of the Kingdom. The weeds are the children of the Evil One.
\p
\v 39 "The enemy who sowed them is the Slanderer. The harvest is the end of the world, and the harvesters are the Messengers of God. \f - \fr 13:39 \ft These Messengers are \w angels\w*. The word \it angel\it* literally means "a messenger."\f*
\p
\v 40 "So just as the weeds are gathered and burned in the fire, that's how it will be at the end of this world.
\p
\v 41 "The Son, a human being, will send out His Messengers, and they will gather out of His Kingdom all stumbling blocks, and all those who do lawlessness,
\p
\v 42 "and will throw them into a furnace of fire. There will be wailing and grinding of teeth.
\p
\v 43 "Then the just will shine out like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. Anyone having ears to hear, let him hear."
\p
\v 44 "The Kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man has found it, he hides it, and he is so happy to have found it that he goes and sells everything he has, and buys that field.
\p
\v 45 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant, looking for valuable pearls.
\p
\v 46 "When he finds one very valuable pearl, he goes and sells everything he has, and buys it.
\p
\v 47 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered every kind of fish.
\p
\v 48 "When it was full, they drew it ashore, and sat down, and gathered the good fish into containers, and threw the bad fish back.
\p
\v 49 "That's how it will be at the end of the world: the Messengers will come out, and separate the wicked from among the just,
\p
\v 50 "and will throw them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and grinding of teeth.
\p
\v 51 "Have you understood all this?" They told them, "Yes, Lord."
\p
\v 52 Then He told them, "For this reason every writer who his taught the things of the Kingdom of heaven is like a householder, who brings out of his treasure-house both new and old things."
\p
\v 53 It happened that when Jesus had finished telling these parables, He left.
\p
\v 54 He came into His own country, and taught them in their synagogue. They were amazed, and said, "Where did this Man get such wisdom, and such mighty works?
\p
\v 55 "This is the carpenter's Son, isn't He? His mother is called Mary, isn't she? And His brothers are James, Simon, and Judas?
\p
\v 56 "And aren't His sisters all with us? So where did this Man get all these things?"
\p
\v 57 And they rejected Him. So Jesus told them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house." \f - \fr 13:57 \ft Compare \w Mark 6:4\w* and \w New American Bible#Outdated or Awkward Translations\w*.\f*
\p
\v 58 And he didn't perform many wonderful deeds there, on account of their unbelief. \f - \fr 13:58 \ft "might works" may be replaced by "miracles", but "wonderful deeds" perhaps better captures the meaning\f*
\c 14
\p
\v 1 At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus. \f - \fr 14:1 \ft This is \w Herod Antipas\w*, the immediate successor to \w Herod\w* the Great.\f*
\p
\v 2 He told his servants, "This is \w John the Baptist\w*. He must have risen from the dead, and that's why these extraordinary signs take place through him." \f - \fr 14:2 \ft "might works" -&gt; "extraordinary signs," rather than "miracles"\f*
\p
\v 3 Herod Antipas had earlier had John arrested, put under restraint, and put in prison for the sake of \w Herodias\w*, the wife of his brother \w Herod Philip\w*,
\p
\v 4 because John used to tell him, "You may not have her for a wife."
\p
\v 5 He wanted to have him executed, but he was afraid of the crowd, because they considered him a prophet.
\p
\v 6 But on the occasion of Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced in the middle of the men and pleased Herod.
\p
\v 7 For that reason he swore to her that he would give her whatever she asked.
\p
\v 8 She, having before been prompted by her mother, said, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a plate."
\p
\v 9 And the king was distressed. But because he had sworn before his dinner guests, who were watching this whole affair, he gave orders that it be given to her.
\p
\v 10 He sent orders to the prison to cut John's head off.
\p
\v 11 His head was brought in on a plate, and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.
\p
\v 12 His students came, claimed the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
\p
\v 13 When Jesus heard about it, He left that place by boat and went to a desert place. When the people heard about this, they followed Him on foot out of the cities.
\p
\v 14 Jesus went out and saw a great crowd, and had pity on them, and healed those among them who were ill.
\p
\v 15 That evening, his students came to him, saying, "This place is a desert, and it's late. Send the crowd away, so that they might go into the villages and buy themselves something to eat."
\p
\v 16 But Jesus told them, "They don't have to leave; why don't you give them something to eat?"
\p
\v 17 And they told Him, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish."
\p
\v 18 He said, "Bring them here to Me."
\p
\v 19 And He ordered thr crowd to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves and two fish. Looking up to heaven, he broke the loaves and gave them to His students, and the students gave them to the crowd.
\p
\v 20 They all ate, and were satisfied. They filled twelve small baskets with the leftover pieces of bread.
\p
\v 21 About five thousand men, in addition to women and children, had eaten.
\p
\v 22 At once Jesus ordered His students to get aboard a boat, and to go ahead of Him to the opposite shore, while He sent the crowds away.
\p
\v 23 When He had sent the crowds away, He went up into a mountain to pray in private. When evening fell, He was there alone.
\p
\v 24 The boat had already gone furlongs away from land and was tossed by the waves, because the wind was a contrary wind.
\p
\v 25 In the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them, walking on top of the sea. \f - \fr 14:25 \ft Day and night were commonly divided into watches, each roughly an hour long, beginning at sunrise or sunset. Depending on the season of the year, this episode could have happened at around 10:00~p.m. local time.\f*
\p
\v 26 And when the students saw him walking on top of the sea, they were troubled, and said among themselves, "It's a ghost!" And they cried out in fear. \f - \fr 14:26 \ft The Greek word \bd φαντασμα\bd* or \it phantasma\it* means the same thing today as it did then: something that someone sees that is not really there.\f*
\p
\v 27 And immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Cheer up! It's I. Don't be afraid."
\p
\v 28 And Peter in answer said, "Lord, if that's You, tell me to come to You on top of the water." \f - \fr 14:28 \ft Peter is asking for a "sign."\f*
\p
\v 29 And He said, "Come." And Peter got down out of the boat and walked on the water, to go to Jesus.
\p
\v 30 But when he saw how the wind was blowing, he was afraid. He started sinking, and cried out, "Lord, save me!"
\p
\v 31 At once Jesus held out His hand, and caught him. And He asked him, "You of little faith, why didn't you trust Me?"
\p
\v 32 They went aboard the boat, and the wind stopped blowing.
\p
\v 33 Then those who were in the boat came and fell down at His feet, saying, "You are definitely the Son of God!"
\p
\v 34 And when they had crossed the lake, they came into the country of Gennesaret.
\p
\v 35 And when the men of that place realized that He was present, they sent messengers into all the surrounding countryside, and brought to Him everyone who had anything wrong with them,
\p
\v 36 and begged Him merely to let them touch the hem of His robe. Whoever so touched Him was made well.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Then several scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem came to Jesus, and said,
\p
\v 2 "Why do your students break the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands when they eat bread." \f - \fr 15:2 \ft The hand-washing was a ritual exercise, another part of the Pharisees' body of extra-Biblical regulations.\f*
\p
\v 3 But He in answer asked them, "Why do you also break the commandment of God by means of your tradition?
\p
\v 4 "God gave this command: 'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'Anyone who curses his father or mother, let him be put to death.'
\p
\v 5 "But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or his mother, "If I help you in any way, I'm doing you a favor,"
\p
\v 6 "'then he does not honor his father.' You have canceled the Truth of God by your tradition. \f - \fr 15:6 \ft The Byzantine manuscripts add "or his mother." And no manuscript has words that would translate as "he shall be set free" or words to any such effect.\f*
\p
\v 7 "You hypocrites, \w Isaiah\w* prophesied accurately about you, when he said,
\p
\v 8 "'This people draws close to Me with their mouth, and honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.
\p
\v 9 "'But they woship Me in vain, when they teach the commandments of men as if they were doctrines.'"
\p
\v 10 And He summoned the crowd, and said to them, "Hear and understand:
\p
\v 11 "It is not what goes into the mouth that makes a man unclean, but what comes out of the mouth, this is what makes a man unclean."
\p
\v 12 Then His students came and said to him, "Did you know that the Pharisees were shocked after hearing what You said?"
\p
\v 13 But in answer He said, "Every plant that My heavenly Father has not planted will be torn up by its roots.
\p
\v 14 "Let them be. They are the blind leading the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch."
\p
\v 15 Then Peter in answer said, "Explain this parable to us."
\p
\v 16 And Jesus said, "Don't you understand anything yet?
\p
\v 17 "Don't you understand yet, that whatever goes in at the mouth goes into the belly, and is thrown down the toilet?
\p
\v 18 "But those things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and they make the man unclean.
\p
\v 19 "Because from the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexually immoral thoughts and acts, lies, and blasphemies.
\p
\v 20 "These are what make a man unclean. But to eat with unwashed hands won't make a man unclean."
\p
\v 21 Then Jesus went away from that place, and traveled to the coastal regions of Tyre and Sidon.
\p
\v 22 And a woman from Canaan came out of those same coastal regions, and cried out to him, saying, "Take pity on me, O Lord, Son of David. My daughter is terribly oppressed with a demon."
\p
\v 23 But He didn't say a word to her in answer. And his student came and begged him, saying, "Send her away, because she keeps crying out after us."
\p
\v 24 But He said in answer, "I am sent only to the lost sheep of the house of \w Israel\w*."
\p
\v 25 Then she came and fell down at His feet, saying, "Lord, help me."
\p
\v 26 And in answer He said, "It is not proper to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
\p
\v 27 And she said, "Yes, Lord. But the dogs eat from the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
\p
\v 28 Then Jesus in answer said, "Woman, your faith is great. Let it be to you even as you wish." And her daughter was made well in that very moment. \f - \fr 15:28 \ft This is one of several examples of \w action-at-a-distance\w* in the \w Gospels\w*.  See also \w Counterexamples to Relativity\w*.\f*
\p
\v 29 And Jesus left that place, and came close to the sea of Galilee, and went up into a mountain and sat down there.
\p
\v 30 Great crowds came to him, having with them people that were lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others. They set them down at Jesus' ffeet, and He healed them,
\p
\v 31 so that the crowd were bug-eye amazed, when they saw mute people speak, maimed people made whole, lame people walk, and blind people see. And they gave glory to the God of Israel.
\p
\v 32 Then Jesus called His students to Him, and said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been keeping up with Me now for three days, and have nothing to eat. I will not send them away hungry; they would pass out on the road if I did."
\p
\v 33 And His students said to Him, "Where can we find enough bread out here in the desert, to feed a big crowd like this?"
\p
\v 34 And Jesus said to them, "How many loaves to you have?" And they said, "Seven, and a few little fish."
\p
\v 35 And he ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground.
\p
\v 36 And He took the seven loaves and the fish, and gave thanks, and broke them, and gave them to his students, and the students gave them to the crowd.
\p
\v 37 And all of them ate, and were satisfied. They took up the leftovers in seven large baskets.
\p
\v 38 And four thousand men, in addition to women and children, ate that meal.
\p
\v 39 And he sent the crowd away, and boarded a boat, and came to the coastal region of Magdala.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 The Pharisees and some Sadducees came and, wishing to test Him, asked Him to show them a sign from heaven.
\p
\v 2 In answer, He said to them, "When it is evening, you say, 'The weather will be fair, because the sky is red.' \f - \fr 16:2 \ft The Greek word \bd πυρραζει\bd* or \it purrhadzei\it* means red like fire.\f*
\p
\v 3 "And in the morning, 'The weather will be bad today, because the sky is red and threatening.' Do you mean to say that on the one hand, you can read the sky, but on the other hand, you can't read the signs of the times? \f - \fr 16:3 \ft The provenance of verses 2 and 3 is doubtful. And no manuscript has any expression including the word for "hypocrites."\f*
\p
\v 4 "A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign, but the only sign they're going to get is the sign of the prophet \w Jonah\w*." And He left them and went away.
\p
\v 5 And when His students had come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
\p
\v 6 Then Jesus told them, "Be careful and watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
\p
\v 7 And they said to themselves, "He said that because we haven't taken any bread with us."
\p
\v 8 When Jesus realized this, he told them, "You of little faith, why do you tell yourselves that it's because you didn't bring any bread?
\p
\v 9 "Don't you understand yet, or even remember the five loaves used to feed the five thousand, and how many small baskets you took up?
\p
\v 10 "Or the seven loaves used to feed the four thousand, and how many large baskets you took up?
\p
\v 11 "How can you fail to understand that I wasn't talking to you about bread, when I said that you should watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees?"
\p
\v 12 Then they understood that He was telling them not to watch out for literal bread baker's yeast, but the teachings of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. \f - \fr 16:12 \ft Some manuscripts have "yeast of the breads" (plural); others singular.\f*
\p
\v 13 When Jesus came to the coastlines of Caesaria Philippi, He asked His students, "Whom do men say that I, the Son, a human being, am?"
\p
\v 14 And they said, "Some people say that you are \w John the Baptist\w*; some say that you are \w Elijah\w*; other say that you are \w Jeremiah\w* or one of the \w prophets\w*."
\p
\v 15 He said to them, "But whom do you say that I am?"
\p
\v 16 And Simon Peter in answer said, "You are the Anointed One, the Son of the Living God." \f - \fr 16:16 \ft The Greek word \bd Χριστος\bd* (\it Christos\it*) and the Hebrew word \bd משיח\bd* or \it Moshiach\it* (anglicized to \it Messiah\it*) both mean the same thing: one anointed with oil.\f*
\p
\v 17 And Jesus said in answer, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah. Because flesh and blood have not revealed it to you, but rather my Father in heaven. \f - \fr 16:17 \ft The Hebrew word \bd בר\bd* or \it bar\it* means "descendant of."\f*
\p
\v 18 "And I say also to you: Your name is Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hell will not win against it. \f - \fr 16:18 \ft The Greek name \bd Πετρος\bd* or \it Petros\it* literally means "Rocky."\f*
\p
\v 18 And I say to you, You are Peter (Rock) and upon this Rock I will build My Church. The very Gates of Hell shall be breached by it! \f - \fr 16:18 \ft People commonly imagine that this passage indicates that the Church will withstand the attack of Hell upon it as if the Church is likened unto a fortress founded on an impregnable rock. Some view this passage as meaning that the Church is on the offense and the Gates of Hell are on the defense, a defense which is failing. The Gates is a defensive device rather than an offensive weapon. The weapon is the Rock. That name had been given to Shim'on by Jesus and he was known throughout Scripture and in actual living by that name. But here the principle of "seeing beyond by seeing through" holds. When a name is given it often requires us to see through the person bearing the name and see, for instance, a whole series of events to happen - a name like "Maher Shalal Hash Baz", or a future task or mission to be - "Jesus", or a specific event, a description a recent past event and a portent of the future  - from Jacob to "Israel", or the Character of God in His relation to Israel or man -"Yohanan". What can be seen through the name of Rock which Shim'on was to bear? - the destruction of Satan's kingdom by the Kingdom of Heaven of which the Church was to be the elite unit in the forefront. Stones were known to be offensive weapons of the 1st century - the stones and boulders cast up by the launchers of the Roman legion against Masada. But the immediate reference to the Rock name born by Simon Peter was the Rock cut out without hands (just as, in Colossians, baptism is circumcision made without hands) which is the last Kingdom, set up by the God of Heaven and thrown against the next to last Kingdom utterly destroying it. "In the time of these kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, and this kingdom will not pass into the hands of another race; it shall shatter and destroy all the previous kingdoms, and itself last for ever - just as you saw [ "and I was looking and I saw a rock cut out of the mountain, a rock untouched by human hands and it struck..."] the stone untouched by hand break from the mountain and shatter iron, bronze, earthenware, silver and gold." Daniel 2: 44,45. \f*
\p
\v 19 "And I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of heaven. Whatever you make binding on earth will be binding in heaven, and whatever you set loose on earth will be set loose in heaven." \f - \fr 16:19 \ft Does this foretell the effect of the observer on eliminating uncertainty in \w quantum mechanics\w*, which was not discovered until 2000 years later?\f*
\p
\v 20 Then he gave His students an order to tell no man that He was Jesus the Christ.
\p
\v 21 From that time forward, Jesus began to demonstrate to His students that He would have to go to Jerusalem and suffer much harsh treatment from the elders and leading priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day. \f - \fr 16:21 \ft To be more specific, He would stand trial before the \w Sanhedrin\w* in \w Jerusalem\w*.\f*
\p
\v 22 Then Peter took him aside and began to scold Him, saying, "Far from it, Lord! This will never happen to You." \f - \fr 16:22 \ft The literal Greek says, "Far from you."\f*
\p
\v 23 But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me. You're not thinking about the things of God, but rather the things of men."
\p
\v 24 Then Jesus told His students, "If any man wants to come after Me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me. \f - \fr 16:24 \ft An illustration of total commitment, with no turning back, and even a willingness to die.\f*
\p
\v 25 "For whoever saves his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.
\p
\v 26 "For how is a man better off, if he wins the whole world, and loses his own soul? And what can a man pay to buy back his soul? \f - \fr 16:26 \ft didōmi means "pay" as in a commercial transaction, not "give" with its modern connotation of receiving nothing in return; ἀντάλλαγμα: means "what is given either in order to keep or to acquire anything," i.e., buying something.\f*
\p
\v 27 "For the Son, a human being, will come in the glory of His Father with His messengers, and then He will reward every man according to the things he did.
\p
\v 28 "I tell you truly: Some people are standing here that will not experience death until they actually see the Son, a human being, coming in His Kingdom."
\c 17
\p
\v 1 Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John, and brought them up into a high mountain for a private meeting,
\p
\v 2 and he was transfigured before their eyes, and his face shone like the \w sun\w*, and his clothes were as white as light.
\p
\v 3 And \w Moses\w* and \w Elijah\w* appeared, and talked with him.
\p
\v 4 Peter said in answer to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here.  If you wish, I will make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah." \f - \fr 17:4 \ft The Byzantine manuscripts say "we will make three tents," but the best manuscripts use the first person singular, not plural.\f*
\p
\v 5 While he was still speaking, a bright cloud threw its shadow over them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, with Whom I am well pleased. Listen to Him."
\p
\v 6 And when the students heard it, they fell on their faces and were very much afraid.
\p
\v 7 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, "Get up, and stop being afraid."
\p
\v 8 And when they look up, they saw no one else but Jesus.
\p
\v 9 And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus gave orders to them: "Don't talk about this vision to anyone, until the Son, a human being, rises from the dead."
\p
\v 10 And His students asked Him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
\p
\v 11 And Jesus told them, "Of course Elijah has to come first, and restore everything.
\p
\v 12 "But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they didn't recognize him, but have done to him what they wanted. Likewise also the Son, a human being, has to suffer at their hands."
\p
\v 13 Then the students understood that He was talking to them about \w John the Baptist\w*.
\p
\v 14 And when they had come to the crowd, a certain man came to Him, kneeling down to Him, and saying,
\p
\v 15 "Lord, have mercy on my son. He is mentally disturbed, and severely afflicted. He will often fall into fire and often into water. \f - \fr 17:15 \ft Again Matthew uses the word best translated as "moonstruck" to describe the patient's condition.\f*
\p
\v 16 "And I brought him to Your students, and they couldn't cure him."
\p
\v 17 Then Jesus in answer said, "Oh you faithless and perverse generation, how long am I going to be with you, and how long am I going to put up with you? Bring him here to Me.":
\p
\v 18 And Jesus scolded the demon, and he came out of him, and the child was cured from that very moment.
\p
\v 19 Then the students came to Jesus privately, and said, "Why couldn't we throw him out?"
\p
\v 20 And Jesus told them, "It was on account of your lack of faith. Because I tell you truly, that if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Take yourself away from here to someplace else,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you." \f - \fr 17:20 \ft The Byzantine manuscripts speak of total unbelief, but most reliable manuscripts speak of a relative lack of faith. It's the same expression that Jesus uses to say, "You of little faith."\f*
\p
\v 21 ["But this kind doesn't go out except by prayer and fasting."] \f - \fr 17:21 \ft The provenance of this verse is disputed.\f*
\p
\v 22 And while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus told them, "The Son, a human being, will be betrayed into the hands of men.
\p
\v 23 "And they will kill Him, and the third day He will rise again." And they were very sorry to hear that.
\p
\v 24 And when they came back to Capernaum, the Temple tax collectors came to Peter, and said, "Doesn't your Teacher pay the Temple tax?" \f - \fr 17:24 \ft The Greek word used is \bd διδραχμα\bd* or \it didrachma\it*, a two-drachma (roughly two-pound) tax that every Jew was expected to pay every year for the upkeep of the \w Temple of Jerusalem\w*.\f*
\p
\v 25 He said, "Yes." And when he had come into the house, Jesus stopped him, saying, "What are you thinking, Simon? Whom do the kings of the earth collect value-added and capitation taxes from? From their own children, or from foreigners?" \f - \fr 17:25 \ft The Greek text uses two separate words for "tax": \bd τελος\bd* (\it telos\it*) and \bd κηνσος\bd* (kensos). The \it kensos\it* is the Latin \it census\it* tax, called a capitation or head tax (and amounted to one Roman dinar, or one day's wages). The \it telos\it*, literally "termination," was probably a value-added tax.\f*
\p
\v 26 Peter said to Him, "From foreigners." Jesus said to him, "Then the children are free.
\p
\v 27 "Still, so that we won't shock them, go to the sea, throw out a hook, and take the first fish that bites. When you open his mouth, you'll find a piece of money in it. Take that, and give it to them for me and for you." \f - \fr 17:27 \ft Jesus provides the tax money with a miracle. It's a minor miracle, but it illustrates an important principle: with God, nothing happens at random.\f*
\c 18
\p
\v 1 In that hour the students came to Jesus, and said, "Who is greatest in the Kingdom of heaven?"
\p
\v 2 And Jesus called a little child to him, and had that child stand in the middle of them,
\p
\v 3 And said, "I tell you truly, unless you have been converted, and become like little children, you will not get into the Kingdom of heaven.
\p
\v 4 "So any person who humbles himself like this little child, will be greatest in the Kingdom of heaven.
\p
\v 5 "And any person who receives even one little child like this in My Name receives Me.
\p
\v 6 "But if any person causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it would be better for him if he had a very large millstone hung around his neck and he were drowned in the deep sea.
\p
\v 7 "How terrible it will be for the world because of stumbling blocks! Stumbling blocks must come, but woe to that man by whom the stumbling block comes!
\p
\v 8 "So if your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut them off, and throw them away from you: it is better to enter into life crippled or maimed than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the everlasting fire.
\p
\v 9 "And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away from you: it is better for you to enter into life blind in one eye, than to have two eyes and be thrown into hellfire.
\p
\v 10 "Be careful not to look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their messengers always look at the face of My Father in heaven.
\p
\v 11 "[For the Son, a human being, came to save what was lost.] \f - \fr 18:11 \ft The provenance of this verse is disputed.\f*
\p
\v 12 "What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them were to wander off, wouldn't he leave the ninety-nine sheep and go into the mountains to look for the wandering sheep?
\p
\v 13 "And if he found it, I tell you truly: he would rejoice more about that sheep, than about the ninety-nine sheep that didn't wander off.
\p
\v 14 "Thus it is not the wish of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should die.
\p
\v 15 "Furthermore: if your brother should sin against you, go and show him what he did wrong between you and him alone. If he listens to you, then you have won your brother over.
\p
\v 16 "But if he won't hear you, then take with you one or two others, so that 'in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be given standing.'
\p
\v 17 "And if he refuses to listen to them, then tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen to the church, then regard him as you would a foreigner and a tax collector.
\p
\v 18 "I tell you truly: whatever you make binding on earth will be binding in heaven, and whatever you set loose on earth will be set loose in heaven.
\p
\v 19 "Again I tell you that if two of you agree on earth with respect to anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven. \f - \fr 18:19 \ft The Greek word for agree is \bd συμφονεομεν\bd* or \it symphoneomen\it*, meaning "We speak with one voice," from which comes the modern word \it symphony\it*.\f*
\p
\v 20 "For where two or three come together in My Name, I am present in their midst."
\p
\v 21 Then Peter came to Him, and said, "Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Seven times?"
\p
\v 22 Jesus told him, "I don't tell you seven times. I tell you, seventy times seven.
\p
\v 23 "In this context the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who was taking an audit from his slaves.
\p
\v 24 "And when he had started his audit, one was brought to him, who owed him ten thousand \w talents\w*. \f - \fr 18:24 \ft The \w talent\w* was the weight of any precious metal that a man could carry on his back. This amounted roughly to seventy-five Avoirdupois pounds, or thirty kilograms. In today's debased money, a single talent would have a value of one and a quarter million \w United States\w* dollars.\f*
\p
\v 25 "But seeing that he did not have the money to pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, along with his wife and children and everything he had, to satisfy the debt.
\p
\v 26 "So the slave fell down and kissed his feet, saying, 'Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay you all.'
\p
\v 27 "Then that slave's lord took pity on him, and set him free, and forgave him the debt.
\p
\v 28 "But that slave went out, and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred shillings. He laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, and said, 'Pay me what you owe.' \f - \fr 18:28 \ft The actual Roman coin referred to was the denarius, or dinar, worth roughly as much as an old British shilling.\f*
\p
\v 29 "And his fellow slave fell down at his feet, and begged him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.'
\p
\v 30 "But he would not. Instead he went and had him thrown into prison, until he paid the debt.
\p
\v 31 "So when his fellow slaves saw what had been done, they were very sorry, and came and told their lord everything that had happened.
\p
\v 32 "Then his lord, after he had called him, said to him, 'You wicked slave, I forgave you all that debt, because you asked me to.
\p
\v 33 "'Shouldn't you also have had pity on your fellow slave, even as I had pity on you?'
\p
\v 34 "And his lord was as angry as a magistrate might be, and delivered him to the torturers, until he should pay all that was due to him.
\p
\v 35 "So likewise My heavenly Father will do also to you, unless each and every one of you forgives his brother his sins, from your hearts."
\c 19
\p
\v 1 And it happened, when Jesus had finished saying these things, He left Galilee and came into the coastal regions of Judea beyond the Jordan.
\p
\v 2 Great crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.
\p
\v 3 The Pharisees also came to Him, to test Him, and said to Him, "May a man \w divorce\w* his wife for every cause?"
\p
\v 4 And in answer He asked them, "Haven't you read, that He Who created them at the beginning 'made them male and female,' \f - \fr 19:4 \ft The Byzantine manuscripts have "made" rather than "created." The quote is from Genesis 1, but though the \w Septuagint\w* renders the original verb "made," the \w Masoretic Text\w* has "created."\f*
\p
\v 5 "And said, 'For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and unite himself to his wife, and the two of them will be one flesh'?
\p
\v 6 "So they aren't two anymore, but one flesh. So what God has joined together, don't let man tear apart."
\p
\v 7 Then they said to Him, "Then why did \w Moses\w* give an order to give a bill of divorcement, and to divorce her?"
\p
\v 8 He told them, "Moses let you divorce your wives on account of your hardheartedness. But it was not that way from the beginning.
\p
\v 9 "And I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, unless he does it by reason of improper behavior before the wedding, and marries someone else, commits \w adultery\w*." \f - \fr 19:9 \ft Again, Matthew was speaking of ancient Jewish betrothal customs, under which an engaged couple were considered as good as married, unless the engaged girl had been found to have behaved improperly before the wedding. Luke, writing as he did to Gentiles, would not need to make any such distinction.\f*
\p
\v 10 His students said to Him, "If that's the case of the man with his wife, then maybe one shouldn't get married." \f - \fr 19:10 \ft \w Paul of Tarsus\w* would return to this very theme; see \w 1_Corinthians 7:1-7\w* .\f*
\p
\v 11 But He told them, "Not all men can accept this ideal, but only those to whom it is given. \f - \fr 19:11 \ft See also \w 1_Corinthians 7:7\w* .\f*
\p
\v 12 "For there are some eunuchs, who were born that way from their mother's womb, and other eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men. And there are those eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the Kingdom of heaven. He who can accept this ideal, let him accept it." \f - \fr 19:12 \ft A eunuch is literally one who has been castrated. Some men had this surgery done on them to make them eligible to serve in high-ranking households. Jesus does not ask that of men, but He figuratively suggests that a man might give up the privilege of marriage and intimacy to serve the Lord full-time.\f*
\p
\v 13 Then some little children were brought to Him there, so that He could lay His hands on them, and pray. The students scolded them.
\p
\v 14 But Jesus said, "Allow the little children to come to Me, and don't tell them not to. The Kingdom of Heaven is made of just such persons."
\p
\v 15 And He laid His hands on them, and left that place.
\p
\v 16 Then someone came and said to Him, "Good Teacher, what good thing should I do, so that I may have eternal life?" \f - \fr 19:16 \ft Some manuscripts omit "Good teacher." However, because in the next verse Jesus scolds the young man for calling Him "good," the adjective should remain here.\f*
\p
\v 17 And He said to him, "Why do you call me 'good'? There is only one good Person. And if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."
\p
\v 18 He said to Him, "Which ones?" Jesus said, "'Do not commit murder; do not commit adultery; do not steal; do not commit perjury;
\p
\v 19 "'honor your father and mother,' and 'Love your neighbor as you love yourself.'"
\p
\v 20 The young man said to Him, "I have kept all these things from my youth until now. What more must I do?"
\p
\v 21 Jesus told him, "If you want to be perfect, go and sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven, and come and follow Me."
\p
\v 22 But when the young man heard that last, he went away feeling sorry, because he had many possessions.
\p
\v 23 Then Jesus told His students, "I tell you truly, that a rich man will enter the Kingdom of heaven only with difficulty.
\p
\v 24 And I say again to you, that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for an idle miser to enter into the kingdom of God." \f - \fr 19:24 \ft "rich man" had a different connotation then than now.  "Idle miser" better captures the original meaning.\f*
\p
\v 25 When His students heard that, they were very much amazed, and said, "Then who can be saved?"
\p
\v 26 But Jesus looked them in the eye and told them, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
\p
\v 27 Then Peter in answer said to Him, "We have given up everything and followed You. So what will we have?"
\p
\v 28 And Jesus told them, "I tell you truly: You who have followed Me, in the Regeneration event, when the Son, a human being, will sit on the throne of His glory, you will also sit on twelve thrones, to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.
\p
\v 29 "And everyone who has given up his house, or his brothers, or his sisters, or his father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for the sake of My Name, will get back a hundred times as much, and will inherit everlasting life.
\p
\v 30 "But many that are first will be last, and the last will be first."
\c 20
\p
\v 1 "For the Kingdom of heaven is like a landowner, who went out at dawn to hire workmen for his vineyard. \f - \fr 20:1 \ft \bd οἰκοδεσπότης\bd* means \it head of the house\it*, householder sounds dated, landowner seems to be more appropriate....\f* \f - \fr 20:1 \ft \bd πρωΐ\bd* at dawn, early in the morning, implying that he uses the whole day\f*
\p
\v 2 "And when he had formed an agreement with the workmen to pay them a silver coin a day, he sent them into his vineyard. \f - \fr 20:2 \ft Silver coin is easily understood, shilling is almost as dated as denarius. (By "shilling" is meant the Roman denarius, worth ten assaria, four sesterces, or forty quadrants.)\f*
\p
\v 3 "And he went out three hours later, and saw others standing without work in the public square, \f - \fr 20:3 \ft This is the \bd αγορα\bd* or \it agora\it*, which served as marketplace and place of legal transactions.\f* \f - \fr 20:3 \ft ἀργός was omitted.\f*
\p
\v 4 "And said to them, 'Go also into the vineyard, and I will pay you whatever wage is just.' \f - \fr 20:4 \ft The phrase \it and they went their way\it* comes from the first words of the next verse οἱ δὲ ἀπῆλθον. \it and they went\it*.\f*
\p
\v 5 "and they went that way. And he went out again at midday and three hours later, and did the same thing. \f - \fr 20:5 \ft The hours of the day began at sunrise, as the hours of night began at sunset.\f*
\p
\v 6 "And an hour before dusk he went out and found others standing around, and said to them, 'Why have you been standing here all day without work?' \f - \fr 20:6 \ft It's the proverbial eleventh hour, the five minutes until midnight.\f*
\p
\v 7 "They said to him, 'Because no man has hired us.' He said to them, 'Go also into the vineyard, and whatever is just, that you will receive.'
\p
\v 8 "So when the evening came, the lord of the vineyard said to his steward, 'Call the workmen, and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.'
\p
\v 9 "And when they who had been hired at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a shilling.
\p
\v 10 "But when the first-hired men came, they thought that they would receive a higher wage, and they also received a shilling.
\p
\v 11 "And when they received it, they started complaining against the master of the house,
\p
\v 12 "saying, 'These last have been working only for one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have carried the load and the heat of the full day.'
\p
\v 13 "But he answered one of them, and said, 'Friend, I'm not doing you any wrong. Didn't you agree to work for me for a shilling?
\p
\v 14 "'Take what is yours, and go on. I wish to give to this last man, even as I have given to you.
\p
\v 15 "'Isn't it lawful for me to do as I wish with what is mine? Is your eye evil, because I am good?' \f - \fr 20:15 \ft At issue is not the principle of "equal pay for comparable worth," but that an employer has the absolute right to pay whatever wage he wishes to pay, so long as he honors his agreements without discrimination. In the same way, \w God\w* has the absolute right to reward those of us who serve Him exactly as He wishes, and He will always reliably honor the agreements He makes.\f*
\p
\v 16 "So the last will be first, and the first last." \f - \fr 20:16 \ft The Byzantine manuscripts add, "For many are called, but few chosen." But this may be an interpolation.\f*
\p
\v 17 And Jesus, while going up to \w Jerusalem\w*, took the Twelve aside on the road for a private consultation. He said to them, \f - \fr 20:17 \ft Jerusalem is an at elevation of 800 meters, the highest of any city; hence the phrase "going up." The most reliable manuscripts speak only of "the Twelve," because that they are the Twelve Apostles is well understood.\f*
\p
\v 18 "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be betrayed to the leading priests and to the scribes, and they will condemn Him to death,
\p
\v 19 "And will deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify Him. And on the third day He will rise again."
\p
\v 20 Then the mother of Zebedee's children came to Him with her sons, falling down at His feet and wanting something from Him.
\p
\v 21 And He said to her, "What do you wish?" She said to Him, "Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on the left, in Your kingdom."
\p
\v 22 But Jesus in answer said, "You don't know what you're asking. Can you drink from the cup that I will drink from, and be baptized with the baptism that I will be baptized with?" And they said to him, "We can."
\p
\v 23 And He said to them, "You will certainly drink from My cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with. But to sit on My right hand, or on My left, is not for Me to grant, but it will be granted to them for whom it is prepared by My Father."
\p
\v 24 And when the other ten heard it, they were indignant toward the two brothers.
\p
\v 25 But Jesus called them to Him, and said, "You know that the leaders of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and that the great ones exercise authority over them.
\p
\v 26 "But it will not be that way among you. If any man wants to be great among you, let him first be your table waiter, \f - \fr 20:26 \ft The Greek word used here is \bd διακονος\bd*, which survives as the English word \w deacon\w*. Thus Jesus prefigures the original appointment of the first deacons; see \w Acts 6\w* .\f*
\p
\v 27 "And if anyone wants to be first, let him be your slave,
\p
\v 28 "Even as the Son of man came not to be waited on, but to wait on others, and to give his life as a ransom for many people."
\p
\v 29 And as they left \w Jericho\w*, a great crowd followed them.
\p
\v 30 Two blind men sitting by the roadside, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, "Have mercy on us, O Lord, son of David."
\p
\v 31 And the crowd scolded them, saying that they should keep quiet. But they cried all the more, saying, "Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David."
\p
\v 32 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, "What do you want me to do for you?"
\p
\v 33 They said to him, "Lord, we want our eyes opened."
\p
\v 34 So Jesus took pity on them, and touched their eyes. Immediately they regained their sight, and followed Him.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 When they approached \w Jerusalem\w* and had come to Bethphage, to \w Mount Olive\w*, Jesus sent two of His students,
\p
\v 2 and told them, "Go into the next village you come to. As soon as you enter it, you will find a tethered donkey and a colt next to her. Untie them and bring them to Me.
\p
\v 3 "And if any man says anything to you, tell them, 'The Lord needs them,' and he'll send them right away."
\p
\v 4 All this was done in order to fulfil that which was spoken by \w Isaiah\w*, who said,
\p
\v 5 "Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King comes unto you, meek, and sitting on a donkey, and a colt that is a donkey's foal."
\p
\v 6 And the students went and did as Jesus told them,
\p
\v 7 and brought the donkey, and the colt, ad put their clothes on them, and they set Him on it.
\p
\v 8 And a very large crowd spread their cloaks in the road; others cut down branches from the trees and strewed them on the road. \f - \fr 21:8 \ft These were \w palm\w* branches. The crowd probably did this, thinking to make the road softer and more tolerable for the donkey and the colt to walk on it.\f*
\p
\v 9 And the crowds that walked ahead and behind shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the Name of the Lord! Hosanna in the Highest!" \f - \fr 21:9 \ft \it Hosanna\it* is an \w Aramaic\w* word meaning "Save, I pray." The formula "Blessed is he who comes" is the Hebrew idiom that means "Welcome."\f*
\p
\v 10 And when he had entered Jerusalem, everyone in the city was moved, and said, "Who is This?"
\p
\v 11 And the crowd said, "This is Jesus the Prophet of Nazareth of Galilee." \f - \fr 21:11 \ft Capitalized on account of Whom we're talking about, the Son of God, not on account of what the speaker might have thought He was.\f*
\p
\v 12 And Jesus went into the \w Temple\w* and threw out everyone who was selling and buying goods in the Temple, and turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the chairs of the dove-sellers, \f - \fr 21:12 \ft Most manuscripts say simply "Temple"; others add "of God."\f*
\p
\v 13 And He told them, "It is written, 'My House shall be called the House of prayer.' But you have made it into a robbers' den." \f - \fr 21:13 \ft Jesus does not mean to say that all commerce is inherently evil. He \it does\it* make the point that commercial activity \it in the Temple\it* can never be proper. It was also the worst example of hypocrisy that He had yet encountered: the Pharisees, with all their regulations, had allowed this crass commercialism to go on in the Temple itself, and had done nothing about it.\f*
\p
\v 14 And blind and lame people came to Him in the Temple, and He healed them.
\p
\v 15 And when the leading priests and the scribes saw the absolutely amazing things that He did, and the children crying in the Temple, and saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were very much displeased. \f - \fr 21:15 \ft The Greek word \bd θαυμασιος\bd* means something so amazing that a person watching it can only say, "Wow!"\f*
\p
\v 16 They told Him, "Do you hear what they're saying?" And Jesus told them, "Of course I have. Haven't you ever read, 'Out of the mouths of babies and sucklings you have made praise complete'?"
\p
\v 17 And He left them, and went out of the city into Bethany, and took up residence there.
\p
\v 18 The next morning, as He came back into the city, He was hungry.
\p
\v 19 And when He saw a fig tree in the road, He came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves. He told it, "Let no fruit grow on you from this moment forward, forever." And immediately the fig tree withered away.
\p
\v 20 And when the students saw it, they were bug-eye shocked, saying, "Look at how fast that fig tree withered away!"
\p
\v 21 In answer, Jesus told them, "I tell you truly: If you have faith, and don't doubt it, you will not only do what was just done to this fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, 'Remove yourself and throw yourself into the sea,' it will happen.
\p
\v 22 "And all thins, whatever you ask in prayer and while believing, you will receive."
\p
\v 23 And when He had entered the Temple, the leading priests and elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching, and said, "By what authority do You do these things, and who gave You this authority?"
\p
\v 24 And in answer Jesus told them, "I will ask you one thing only. If you tell me, then I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
\p
\v 25 "Where did the baptism of \w John the Baptist\w* come from? From heaven, or from men?" And they spoke among themselves, and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' then He will ask us, 'So why didn't you believe him?'
\p
\v 26 "But if we say, 'From men,' then there's no telling what all these people will do, because everyone thinks that John was a prophet."
\p
\v 27 So in answer to Jesus, they said, "We don't know." And He told them, "In that case, I won't tell you by what authority I do these things.
\p
\v 28 "But what do you think? A certain man had two sons. He came to the first, and said, 'Son, go and work today in my vineyard.'
\p
\v 29 "In answer, he said, 'I don't want to.' But later he changed his mind, and went.
\p
\v 30 "And he came to the other one, and said the same thing. And in answer, He said, "I am going, sir," but he did not go.
\p
\v 31 "Which of those two did what his father wished?" They said to him, "The first." Jesus told them, "I tell you truly: the tax-collectors and the prostitutes will go into the Kingdom of God ahead of you.
\p
\v 32 "For John came to you by the road of justice, and you didn't believe him. But the tax gatherers and prostitutes believe him. And you, when you saw that happen, did not change your minds afterward, so that you might believe him.
\p
\v 33 "I'll tell you another parable: A certain householder planted a vineyard, and planted a hedge around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and rented it out to tenant farmers and went away on a long trip.
\p
\v 34 "When vintage time approached, he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect the fruits of the vintage.
\p
\v 35 "And the tenants took his slaves, and beat one, killed another, and stoned another.
\p
\v 36 "Again he sent other slaves, in fact more the second time, and they did the same thing to them.
\p
\v 37 "But he finally sent his son to them, saying, "They will have proper respect for my son."
\p
\v 38 "But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, "This is the heir. Let's kill him and seize the inheritance for ourselves."
\p
\v 39 "And they caught him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
\p
\v 40 "Now when the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?"
\p
\v 41 They told Him, "He will ignominiously destroy those wicked men, and rent out his vineyard to other tenants, who will pay him his rightful share of the vintage."
\p
\v 42 Jesus told them, "Didn't you ever read in the Scriptures, 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the primary cornerstone: this is the Lord's doing, and it is amazing in our eyes'?
\p
\v 43 "So I tell you: The Kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and given to a nation that will produce Its fruits.
\p
\v 44 "And whoever falls on this stone will be broken. But whomever it falls on will be crushed." \f - \fr 21:44 \ft The provenance of this verse is not universally accepted and seems out-of-place.\f*
\p
\v 45 And when the leading priests and the Pharisees had heard his parables, they recognized that He was talking about them.
\p
\v 46 But when they looked for a way to lay hands on him, they were afraid of the crowd, because they took Him for a prophet.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 In answer, Jesus spoke to them again by means of parables, and said,
\p
\v 2 "The Kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who arranged a marriage for his son,
\p
\v 3 "and sent out his slaves to call the invitees to the wedding, and they didn't want to come.
\p
\v 4 "He sent his slaves out again, saying, "Tell the invitees, 'I have gotten my dinner ready; my oxen and my fatted calves have been slaughtered; everything is ready. Come to the wedding.'"
\p
\v 5 "But they blew it off, and went their ways. One went to his farm, and another to his merchandise.
\p
\v 6 "And the rest of them took his slaves, treated them disgracefully, and killed them.
\p
\v 7 "The king was furious, as a magistrate might be, and he sent out his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned down their city.
\p
\v 8 "Then he told his slaves, 'The wedding is ready, but the original invitees didn't deserve to come.
\p
\v 9 "'So go into the roads, and invite as many people as you can find to the wedding.'
\p
\v 10 "So those slaves went out into the roads, and gathered together everyone they could find, good or bad, and the wedding had plenty of guests.
\p
\v 11 "But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who was not properly dressed for a wedding.
\p
\v 12 "And he said to him, 'Friend, how did you get in here without the proper clothes for a wedding?' And he couldn't say a word.
\p
\v 13 "Then the king told his slaves, 'Tie him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.'
\p
\v 14 "For many are called, but few chosen." \f - \fr 22:14 \ft This is the proper place for a verse that had been interpolated earlier.\f*
\p
\v 15 "Then the Pharisees went away and held a meeting about how they might trap Him into saying something embarrassing.
\p
\v 16 And they send out to Him their own students with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that You are true, and teach the way of God in truth, and that You don't care about any man, because You are no Respecter of persons. \f - \fr 22:16 \ft The Herodians were partisans of \w Herod Antipas\w* and the royal family of the Herods.\f*
\p
\v 17 "So tell us what you think? Is it proper to pay the census tax to Caesar, or not?" \f - \fr 22:17 \ft The particular tax is called \bd κηνσος\bd* or \it kensos\it*. This is a direct transliteration, into Greek, of the Latin \it census\it* tax.\f*
\p
\v 18 But Jesus knew exactly the sort of wicked people He was dealing with. So He said, "Why are you always testing Me, you hypocrites?
\p
\v 19 "Show me the coin that you use to pay the census tax." And they brought him a Roman shilling. \f - \fr 22:19 \ft Specifically, the denarius, or dinar, a typical day's wages.\f*
\p
\v 20 And He said to them, "Whose face and epigram is this?"
\p
\v 21 They told Him, "Caesar's." So He told them, "So give Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God."
\p
\v 22 When they heard these words, they were stupefied, and left Him, and went on their way.
\p
\v 23 On the same day the Sadducees came to Him. (The Sadducees say that there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead.) They asked Him,
\p
\v 24 "Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies and leaves no children, his brother must marry his wife.' \f - \fr 22:24 \ft The Sadducees quote the Levirate Law from Deuteronomy.\f*
\p
\v 25 "Now there were seven brothers with us. The first brother married, then died and left no issue, so his wife married his brother.
\p
\v 26 "And the second brother did the same, and the third, and so on to the seventh.
\p
\v 27 "Finally the woman died as well.
\p
\v 28 "Now: in the resurrection, whom is she married to? All seven had married her!"
\p
\v 29 In answer, Jesus said, "You are mistaken. You don't know either the Scriptures or the power of God. \f - \fr 22:29 \ft In other words, the Sadducees haven't done their homework.\f*
\p
\v 30 "People in the resurrection neither marry nor are given away in marriage. To the contrary, they are like God's Messengers in heaven. \f - \fr 22:30 \ft This does not mean that Resurrected people will actually \it be\it* angels. But it does say that angels do not marry. Angels are a company, not a race.\f*
\p
\v 31 "But while we're on the subject of the resurrection of the dead: haven't you read what God Himself said? He said,
\p
\v 32 "'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' He is not the God of dead people, but of live people."
\p
\v 33 When the crowd heard this, they were amazed at His teaching.
\p
\v 34 When the Pharisees heard that He had shut the Sadducees up, they held a meeting.
\p
\v 35 Then one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question to test Him, and said, \f - \fr 22:35 \ft This "lawyer" was a teacher of Jewish law. Rome had no dedicated lawyers.\f*
\p
\v 36 "'Teacher, what is the most important commandment in the Law?'"
\p
\v 37 Jesus said to Him, "'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and all your soul, and all your mind.'
\p
\v 38 "This is the first and most important commandment.
\p
\v 39 "The second is just as important: 'You shall love your neighbor as you love yourself.'
\p
\v 40 "On these two commandments, the entire law depends, and the prophets."
\p
\v 41 While the Pharisees were still meeting, Jesus asked them,
\p
\v 42 "What do you think about the Anointed One? Whose son is He?" They said to him, "The son of David."
\p
\v 43 He said to them, "So how does David in spirit call Him Lord, when he said,
\p
\v 44 "'The \nd LORD\nd* said to my Lord, "Sit on My right hand, until I make Your enemies Your footstool?"' \f - \fr 22:44 \ft The expression \nd LORD\nd* is actually the \w Tetragrammaton\w*, which in Hebrew is \bd יהוה\bd* or \it YHWH\it*.\f*
\p
\v 45 "So if David calls Him Lord, how can He be his son?"
\p
\v 46 And no one could say a word to Him in answer, and neither did any man dare ask Him any more questions from that day forward.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 Now Jesus spoke to the crowd, and to His students,
\p
\v 2 saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit in the seat of Moses.
\p
\v 3 "So whatever they tell you to do, you do and keep. But don't follow their example. They say, but they don't do.
\p
\v 4 "They prepare burdens that are heavy and hard to carry, and lay them on other people's shoulders, but they themselves will not lift a finger to help anyone carry them.
\p
\v 5 "They do everything that they do in order to be seen by men. They make their Scripture carrying cases broad, and make their tassels large, \f - \fr 23:5 \ft In \w Deuteronomy 6:8\w* , \w Moses\w* told the Jews to keep the words of God on their hands and on their foreheads. Furthermore he told them to write the word on their doorposts and gates. But whether Moses meant this literally or figuratively is an open question. The Pharisees took this command to a ridiculous extreme&#8212;and more to the point, that, together with the oversized tassels and other things that Jesus describes of their behavior, is all a sham.\f*
\p
\v 6 "And love the couches of honor at public banquets, and seats of honor in the synagogues,
\p
\v 7 "And greedings in the public squares, and to be called 'Rabbi! Rabbi!' by men.
\p
\v 8 "Don't ask to be called 'Rabbi.' You have only One Teacher, namely Christ; and all of you are brothers.
\p
\v 9 "And don't call any man your father on earth. You have only One Father, Who is in heaven.
\p
\v 10 "Don't ask to be called masters. You have only One Master, namely Christ.
\p
\v 11 "But the greatest among you will be your table-waiter.
\p
\v 12 "And anyone who brings himself up will be brought low, and anyone who brings himself low will be brought up.
\p
\v 13 "But it will be terrible for you, you scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are shutting people out of the Kingdom of heaven. You don't go in yourselves, and don't let anyone else go in.
\p
\v 14 "How terrible for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You eat widows out of their houses, and make a long prayer, but you're only pretending. So you will be condemned all the worse for that. \f - \fr 23:14 \ft The provenance of this verse is doubtful, but it is in character with every other accusation that Jesus made against the Pharisees.\f*
\p
\v 15 "How terrible for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You scour sea and land to make one convert, but when you've converted him, you make him twice the child of hell you are.
\p
\v 16 "How terrible for you, you blind guides! You say, 'If you swear by the \w Temple\w*, that's nothing, but if you swear by the \w gold\w* of the Temple, you're in debt.'
\p
\v 17 "You blind morons! Which is more important, the gold, or the Temple that makes that gold holy?
\p
\v 18 "And: 'If you swear by the altar, that's nothing, but if you swear by the gift on the altar, you're in debt.'
\p
\v 19 "You blind morons! Which is greater, the gift, or the altar that makes that gift holy?
\p
\v 20 "So in fact, if someone swears by the altar, he's swearing by the alter and everything on it.
\p
\v 21 "And if he swears by the Temple, he's swearing by the Temple and everything in it.
\p
\v 22 "And if he swears by heaven, he's swearing by the throne of God, and by Him Who sits on it. \f - \fr 23:22 \ft It's worth repeating here that Jesus said, in the Sermon on the Mount, that people shouldn't take oaths, for this very reason.\f*
\p
\v 23 "How terrible for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You pay ten percent of \w mint\w* and \w anise\w* and \w cummin\w*, and have neglected the more important matters of law, and judgment, and mercy, and faith.
\p
\v 24 "You blind guides! You're straining at a \w gnat\w* while swallowing a \w camel\w*.
\p
\v 25 "How terrible for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and the platter, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
\p
\v 26 "You blind Pharisee, first clean the things in the cup and platter, and then the outside will be clean, too.
\p
\v 27 "How terrible for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs. They certainly look beautiful on the outside, but on the inside they are full of dead men's bones and all sorts of unclean things. \f - \fr 23:27 \ft A tomb typically contains things that are unclean by any standard, not just the ceremonial.\f*
\p
\v 28 "And just like them, you also look just to men on the outside, but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
\p
\v 29 "How terrible for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are building the tombs of the prophets, and decorating the burial caves of the just.
\p
\v 30 "And you say, 'If we had been alive in the days of our father, we wouldn't have taken part with them in killing the prophets.'
\p
\v 31 "Thus you are testifying against yourselves, that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets.
\p
\v 32 "So fill up the measure of your fathers.
\p
\v 33 "You snakes, you jerks, how can you escape being sentenced to the eternal fire?
\p
\v 34 "For this reason, behold: I am sending you prophets, and wise men, and scribes. You will kill and crucify some of them, and have some of them scourges in your synagogues, and persecute them from one city to another,
\p
\v 35 "in order that all the just blood that has been shed on the earth will come on your heads, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the Temple and the altar. \f - \fr 23:35 \ft This is actually the eponymous prophet, not the \w High Priest\w* of that name who also died in a similar manner and location.\f*
\p
\v 36 "I tell you truly: this generation will be held to answer for all of these things.
\p
\v 37 "O \w Jerusalem\w*, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets, and stones those that are sent to you, how often have I wanted to gather My children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you didn't want that!
\p
\v 38 "Your house is left to you empty and abandoned.
\p
\v 39 "Because I say to you: You will not see me again, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the Name of the Lord.'"
\c 24
\p
\v 1 And Jesus went out, away from the \w Temple\w*. His students came to Him to show Him the Temple buildings.
\p
\v 2 And Jesus told them, "Do you see all these things? I tell you truly: there won't be one stone left on top of another, that won't be torn down."
\p
\v 3 And as he sat on \w Mount Olive\w*, the students came to Him privately, and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and the end of the world?"
\p
\v 4 And Jesus in answer told them, "Make sure not to let anyone lie to you.
\p
\v 5 "Many men will come in My Name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many others.
\p
\v 6 "You are about to hear about wars and rumors of wars. Make sure not to worry about that; all these things have to happen, but this isn't the end.
\p
\v 7 "Ethnic groups and nation-states will fight against one another, and famines and earthquakes will strike in various places. \f - \fr 24:7 \ft Many manuscripts add "and pandemics" between the famines and the earthquakes.\f*
\p
\v 8 "All these things are the beginning of birth-pains.
\p
\v 9 "Then they will bind you over to be punished, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all ethnic groups on account of My Name.
\p
\v 10 "And then many people will start to have doubts, and will double-cross one another, and will come to hate one another.
\p
\v 11 "Many false prophets will arise and deceive many people.
\p
\v 12 "And because lawlessness will be overwhelmingly present, the love of many people will die out.
\p
\v 13 "But anyone who can endure until the end, will be saved.
\p
\v 14 "And this Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in all the world as a testimony to all ethnic groups. That's when the end will come.
\p
\v 15 "So when you see the Abomination that Makes Desolate, that \w Daniel\w* the prophet spoke about, standing in the Holy Place (and those who read about this will know what I'm talking about),
\p
\v 16 "then anyone in Judea needs to run to the high hills.
\p
\v 17 "If anyone is on the housetop, he should not come down to take anything out of his house.

\p
\v 20 "And pray that you won't have to flee in the wintertime, or on the Sabbath day.
\p
\v 21 "Because then a great oppression will supervene, such as has not been seen since the beginning of the world until this time, nor ever will be seen again.
\p
\v 22 "In fact, if those days weren't cut short, no one would be saved. But for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be cut short.
\p
\v 23 "Then if anyone says to you, "Look! Christ is here!" (or "there!"), don't believe it.
\p
\v 24 "False Christs, and false prophets, will arise, and will show great signs and wonders, so much so that they could deceive even the chosen ones if they could.
\p
\v 25 "Remember, I went over this before.

\v 26 "So if they tell you, 'Look! He's in the desert!' don't go. Or if they say, 'Look! He's in the private rooms!" don't believe it.
\p
\v 27 "Because as lightning comes out of the east, and shines even to the western sky, that's how the coming of the Son of man will be.
\p
\v 28 "For wherever the dead body is, the vultures will be flocking together. \f - \fr 24:28 \ft The \w vulture\w* described here is the Middle Eastern black vulture \it Gyps fulvus\it* that has the wingspan of an \w eagle\w* and tends to nest in very high elevations.\f*
\p
\v 29 "Immediately after the oppression of those days, the \w sun\w* will be darkened, and the \w moon\w* will not give its light, and the \w stars\w* will fall from the sky, and the powers of the skies will be shaken. \f - \fr 24:29 \ft The Greek word \bd φεγγος\bd* or \it phengos\it* refers to reflected light, not the primary light from a body like the sun.\f* \f - \fr 24:29 \ft The "falling stars" will likely be \w meteors\w*.

\v 9 "But the sensible ones said in answer, 'We can't do that; we wouldn't have enough oil for all of us. Instead, go to the sellers and buy oil for yourselves.'
\p
\v 10 "And while they were going to buy oil, the bridegroom came. Those who were ready went in with him to the wedding, and the door was shut.
\p
\v 11 "Afterward the other bridesmaids came also, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us!'
\p
\v 12 But in answer he said, 'I tell you truly: I don't know you.'
\p
\v 13 "So stay alert, because you don't know either the day or the hour." \f - \fr 25:13 \ft The Byzantine manuscripts add "when the Son of man comes" to that last.\f*
\p
\v 14 "A certain man was going away from home on a long trip. He called his own slaves and entrusted his goods to them.
\p
\v 15 "To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his particular ability, and left on his trip right away. \f - \fr 25:15 \ft The \w talent\w* was the weight of any precious metal that a man could carry on his back.\f*
\p
\v 16 "Then the one who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.
\p
\v 17 "And likewise the one who received the two, also made another two.
\p
\v 18 "But the one who received the one talent went and dug in the earth and hid his lord's money. \f - \fr 25:18 \ft The Greek word used here for money is \bd αργυριον\bd*, or \w silver\w*. Therefore these were probably silver talents that the slaves had to work with.\f*
\p
\v 19 "After a long time the lord of these slaves came back and settled accounts with them.
\p
\v 20 "And so the one who had received the five talents came and brought five more talents, and said, 'Lord, you entrusted five talents to me; I have made five talents more.'
\p
\v 21 "His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave. You have been faithful over a few things, so I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'
\p
\v 22 "Also, the one who had received two talents came and said, 'Lord, you entrusted two talents to me. Behold, I have made two more talents besides these.'
\p
\v 23 "His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave. You have been faithful over a few things, so I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'
\p
\v 24 "Then the one who had received the one talent came and said, 'Lord, I knew that you are a hard man, and that you reap where you haven't sown, and gather where you haven't threshed.
\p
\v 25 "'And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Here is your money back.'
\p
\v 26 "In answer, his lord told him, 'You wicked and lazy slave, you knew that I reap where I haven't sown, and gather where I haven't threshed.
\p
\v 27 "'So you should have given my money to the moneychangers, and then when I came back I would have had my money back with interest.
\p
\v 28 "'So take the talent from him, and give it to the one who has the ten talents.
\p
\v 29 "'Because to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundant amount. But from him who has nothing, even what little he has will be taken away.
\p
\v 30 "'And throw the worthless slave into outer darkness; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.'
\p
\v 31 "When the Son of man comes in His glory, and all the holy Messengers with Him, He will then sit on the throne of His glory.
\p
\v 32 "Before him will be gathered all races of man, and he will separate them from one another, the way a shepherd separates his \w sheep\w* from the \w goats\w*.
\p
\v 33 "He will set the sheep to his right, and the goats to his left. \f - \fr 25:33 \ft Perhaps this should be translated as "He will set the sheep to his conservative side, and the goats to his liberal side."  The Greek word "δεξιός" (translated here as "right") can be translated metaphorically as "cautious authority"; "εὐώνυμος" (translated here as "left") can be translated metaphorically as "unlucky", "sinister" or ... "liberal"?\f*
\p
\v 34 "Then the King will say to those on His right hand, 'Come, you who are blessed by My Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you since the foundation of the world.
\p
\v 35 "'When I was hungry, you gave Me food. When I was thirsty, you gave Me drink. When I was a stranger, you took Me in.
\p
\v 36 "'When I was naked, you clothed Me. I was sick, and you visited Me. I was in prison, and you came to Me.'
\p
\v 37 "Then the just will say in answer, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You? Or thirsty, and give You drink?
\p
\v 38 "'When did we see You a stranger, and take You in? Or naked, and clothe You?
\p
\v 39 "'Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?'
\p
\v 40 "And the King will tell them in answer, 'I tell you truly: to the extent that you have done it for the least of these My brothers, you have done it for Me.'
\p
\v 41 "Then he'll also say to those on His left hand, 'Go away from Me, you accursed ones, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the Slanderer and his messengers.
\p
\v 42 "'I was hungry, and you gave Me nothing to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave Me nothing to drink.
\p
\v 43 "'I was a stranger, and you didn't take Me in. I was naked, and you didn't clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit Me.'
\p
\v 44 "Then they also will tell Him in answer, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and not wait on You?'
\p
\v 45 "Then He will say in answer to them, 'I tell you truly: to the extent that you failed to do this for one of the least of these, you failed to do it for Me.'
\p
\v 46 "And these people will go away into eternal punishment, but the just into eternal life."
\c 26
\p
\v 1 And it happened, when Jesus had finished saying all these things, He said to His students,
\p
\v 2 "You know that the feast of Passover takes place in two days, and the Son of man will be betrayed to be crucified."
\p
\v 3 Then the leading priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people assembled together, in the palace of the \w High Priest\w*, \w Caiaphas\w* by name,
\p
\v 4 and held a meeting on how they might arrest Jesus by treachery and have Him killed.
\p
\v 5 But they said, "We cannot do it on the feast day; if we do, the people will riot."
\p
\v 6 Now when Jesus was staying in Bethany, in the home of Simon the leper,
\p
\v 7 a woman came to him who had an alabaster box of very expensive ointment. She poured it out onto his head as he reclined to dine.
\p
\v 8 And when His students saw it, they were indignant. "What a waste!" they said.
\p
\v 9 "This ointment might have been sold for a lot of money, money we could have given to the poor!"
\p
\v 10 When Jesus realized what was happening, He said, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good work for Me.
\p
\v 11 "You will always have the poor with you, but you won't always have Me.
\p
\v 12 "When she poured out this ointment on My body, she did it for My funeral.
\p
\v 13 I tell you truly: wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, this thing that this woman has done will also be talked of as a memorial of her."
\p
\v 14 Then one of the Twelve, named \w Judas Iscariot\w*, went to the members of the \w Sanhedrin\w*,
\p
\v 15 and asked them, "What will you pay me if I deliver Him to you?" They hired him for thirty pieces of \w silver\w*. \f - \fr 26:15 \ft Oddly, Delilah's price for betraying \w Samson\w* was fifty-five hundred pieces of silver, eleven hundred from each of the Lords of the Five Cities. One could, therefore, argue that Judas sold Jesus out fairly cheaply by comparison.\f*
\p
\v 16 And from that time forward he looked for a chance to betray Him.
\p
\v 17 Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread the students came to Jesus, saying to Him, "Where do you want us to prepare a place for You to eat the Passover meal?"
\p
\v 18 And He said, "Go into the city to a certain man, and tell him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with My students."'"
\p
\v 19 And the students did as Jesus had instructed them, and prepared the Passover.
\p
\v 20 That evening, He sat down with the Twelve.
\p
\v 21 As they were eating, He said, "I tell you truly: one of you will betray Me."
\p
\v 22 And they were very much distressed, and every one of them started asking Him, "Lord, it isn't I, is it?"
\p
\v 23 In answer He said, "The one dipping His hand with Me in the dish, is the one who will betray Me.
\p
\v 24 "The Son of man is going as it was written that He would go. But it will be terrible for that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born."
\p
\v 25 Then Judas (who eventually did betray Him) said in answer, "Teacher, it isn't I, is it?" He said to him, "You've said it."
\p
\v 26 As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the students, and said, "Take. Eat. This is My Body."
\p
\v 27 And, taking a cup, He gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "Drink from this, all of you. \f - \fr 26:27 \ft Some manuscripts have "\it the\it* cup."\f*
\p
\v 28 "For this is My Blood of the Testament, Which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins. \f - \fr 26:28 \ft Some manuscripts have "New Testament."\f*
\p
\v 29 "But I tell you, from now on I will not drink of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's Kingdom.
\p
\v 30 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into \w Mount Olivet\w*.
\p
\v 31 Then Jesus told them, "All of you will have doubts about Me this night. Scripture says, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered abroad.'
\p
\v 32 "But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
\p
\v 33 Peter, in answer, said to Him, "Even if all men doubt You, I will never doubt You."
\p
\v 34 Jesus told him, "I tell you truly: on this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
\p
\v 35 Peter told him, "Even if I die with You, I will never deny You." The other students said the same.
\p
\v 36 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the students, "Stay here, while I go and pray over there."
\p
\v 37 He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with Him, and began to be pained and distressed.
\p
\v 38 Then He told them, "My soul is very distressed, even to death. Stay here and keep watch with Me."
\p
\v 39 And He went a little further on, and fell on His face, and prayed, "O Father, if You can, let this cup pass from Me. But don't do what I want, but rather what You want."
\p
\v 40 And he came to the students, and found them asleep, and said to Peter, "Couldn't you stay up with Me for one hour?
\p
\v 41 "Stay up and pray that you not enter into a test. The spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh is weak."
\p
\v 42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, "My Father, if this cup cannot pass from Me unless I drink from it, then let it be done as You wish."
\p
\v 43 And He came and found them asleep again, because their eyes were heavy.
\p
\v 44 And He left them, and went away again, and prayed for a third time, saying the same words.
\p
\v 45 Then He came to His disciples, and told them, "Sleep on now, and take your rest. The hour has arrived, and the Son of man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\p
\v 46 "Get up, and let's go. Behold, the one who is to betray me has arrived."
\p
\v 47 And while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, came. With him came a great crowd armed with swords and sticks, from among the leading priests and elders of the people.
\p
\v 48 Now the traitor gave them a sign. He said, "The Man that I kiss, He is the One. Hold Him fast."
\p
\v 49 And at once he came to Jesus, and said, "Hello, Teacher," and kissed Him.
\p
\v 50 And Jesus said to him, "Friend, why have you come?" Then the crowd came, and laid hands on Jesus, and arrested Him.
\p
\v 51 And then one of the men with Jesus reached with his hand, drew his sword, and struck a slave of the High Priest and cut off his ear.
\p
\v 52 Then Jesus told him, "Put your sword back into its place. Everyone who takes the sword will die by the sword.
\p
\v 53 "Do you really think that I can't pray to My Father, and He wouldn't immediately give Me more than twelve brigades of His messengers? \f - \fr 26:53 \ft The military unit that Jesus named was the Roman \w legion\w*. A legion typically included six thousand troops and auxiliaries, which is actually more than a modern infantry brigade.\f*
\p
\v 54 "But in that case, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled, the ones that say that this is how it has to be?"
\p
\v 55 In that same hour Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out as you would against an insurrectionist, to arrest Me with swords and sticks? I was sitting every day with you, teaching in the Temple, and you didn't arrest Me then."
\p
\v 56 But all this happened, so that the Scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled. Then all the students left Him behind, and ran away.
\p
\v 57 And those who had arrested Jesus led Him away to \w Caiaphas\w* the \w High Priest\w*, where the scribes and the elders were already assembled. \f - \fr 26:57 \ft This was a middle-of-the-night session of the \w Sanhedrin\w*, a process of highly dubious legality in and of itself.\f*
\p
\v 58 But Peter followed Him at a distance to the palace of the \w High Priest\w*, and went in, and sat with the attendants, to see the end.
\p
\v 59 Now the leading priests, and the elders, and the entire Sanhedrin, sought trumped-up testimony against Jesus, to have Him condemned to death.
\p
\v 60 But they found none. Even though many lying witnesses came, they still found none. At last came two lying witnesses,
\p
\v 61 who said, "This fellow said, 'I can destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
\p
\v 62 And the \w High Priest\w* got up, and said to Him, "Have you no answer to what these witnesses are saying against You?"
\p
\v 63 But Jesus kept quiet. Then the High Priest in answer said, "I am putting you under oath by the living God: Tell us whether you are the Messiah, the Son of God."
\p
\v 64 Jesus said to him, "You just said it. Nevertheless I tell you: Hereafter you will see 'the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.'"
\p
\v 65 Then the High Priest tore his clothes, and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need witnesses anymore? You have heard His blasphemy! \f - \fr 26:65 \ft The ritual tearing of clothes (specifically, ripping one's robe down the middle) was a sign of deep mourning or extreme indignation. But Caiaphas broke the regulations on his conduct by doing this.\f*
\p
\v 66 "How say you?" In answer, they voted "Guilty and sentenced to death." \f - \fr 26:66 \ft This was a taking of a verdict.\f*
\p
\v 67 Then they spat in His face, and struck Him, and others slapped Him with the flats of their hands,
\p
\v 68 and said, "Who hit You, Messiah? Guess!"
\p
\v 69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the palace. A young woman came to him, saying, "You were also with Jesus of Galilee."
\p
\v 70 But he denied it in front of everyone, saying, "I don't know what you're talking about!"
\p
\v 71 And when he had gone out onto the portico, another young woman saw him, and said to everyone present, "This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth!"
\p
\v 72 And again he denied; this time he swore and said, "I don't know the Man!"
\p
\v 73 And after awhile the bystanders came up to him and said to Peter, "You have to be one of them; your own words give you away."
\p
\v 74 Then he started to curse and swear, saying, "I don't know the Man!" And immediately the rooster crowed.
\p
\v 75 And Peter remembered the words that Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 The next morning, all the leading priests and elders of the people held a conference against Jesus, seeking a means to have Him executed. \f - \fr 27:1 \ft The \w Sanhedrin\w*, being merely an advisory body and subject to \w Roman\w* law, had no authority to order anyone executed.\f*
\p
\v 2 And they bound Him, led Him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor. \f - \fr 27:2 \ft In short, the Sanhedrin sought a Roman warrant for Christ's execution, and they could get it only from the governor of Judea Province.\f*
\p
\v 3 Then Judas, who had betrayed Him, when he saw that He had been convicted, had a change of mind, and brought the thirty pieces of \w silver\w* back to the leading priests and elders,
\p
\v 4 and told them, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." And they said, "So what? That's your problem, not ours." \f - \fr 27:4 \ft Some manuscripts use a different Greek word that means "just" or "righteous." The favorite word is the one meaning "innocent" in the sense "not guilty."\f*
\p
\v 5 And he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple, and left, and went out and killed himself. \f - \fr 27:5 \ft The Greek word \bd απαγχομαι\bd* or \it apagchomai\it* is sometimes translated "I kill myself by hanging." However, it is actually the middle-voice form of \bd απαγω\bd* which actually means "I put someone to death"&#8212;by any means. Matthew does not actually give any greater detail than this about how Judas died, but Luke does, in \w Acts 1\w* .\f*
\p
\v 6 And the leading priests took the silver pieces, and said, "We can't put this into the treasury; this is blood money."
\p
\v 7 And they held a conference, and used the money to buy a potter's field for burying foreigners. \f - \fr 27:7 \ft The Greek words used literally \it do\it* mean "a potter's field" and carries the same connotation as that English phrase carries today.\f*
\p
\v 8 And that is why that field is called the Field of Blood, even today.
\p
\v 9 Thus these words were fulfilled that were spoken by the prophet \w Jeremiah\w*: "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the Precious One, held precious by the children of Israel,
\p
\v 10 "and gave them to buy a potter's field, as the Lord instructed Me." \f - \fr 27:10 \ft Some manuscripts say "threw" rather than "gave".\f*
\p
\v 11 And Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked Him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"
\p
\v 12 And when He was accused by the leading priests and elders, He gave no answer.
\p
\v 13 Then Pilate said to him, "Don't you hear how many things to which they testify against You?"
\p
\v 14 And Jesus never said one word in answer, so that the governor was shocked as he had never been shocked before. \f - \fr 27:14 \ft Presumably Pilate had never seen anything like this in his career in public life, nor heard any fellow Senator tell a similar tale from his days as a magistrate in the provinces.\f*
\p
\v 15 Now at the festival the governor was accustomed to release to the people a prisoner, whomever they wanted released.
\p
\v 16 And at the time they held a notable prisoner, named Barabbas. \f - \fr 27:16 \ft Some manuscripts actually preface the name "Barabbas" with "Jesus", which doesn't make much sense.\f*
\p
\v 17 So when they were assembled, Pilate told them, "Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus that is called Christ?"
\p
\v 18 Because he knew that they had handed Him over out of envy.
\p
\v 19 When he had sat down on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message: "Don't have anything to do with That Just Man. I have had many nightmares today on His account!" \f - \fr 27:19 \ft The Greek word \bd βημα\bd* was the word used for "judgment seat." To be more specific, this was the classic semicircular and backless \w curule chair\w* on which Roman magistrates sat when they held court.\f*
\p
\v 20 But the leading priests and elders had persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
\p
\v 21 The governor said in answer, "Which of these two do you want me to release to you?" They said, "Barabbas."
\p
\v 22 Pilate said to them, "Then what should I do with Jesus called Christ?" They asll said to him, "Let Him be crucified!"
\p
\v 23 And the governor said, "Why? What crime has He committed?" But they cried out even more loudly: "Let Him be crucified!"
\p
\v 24 When Pilate realized that he could not win, and indeed risked having a riot on his hands, he took water, and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; this is your responsibility!" \f - \fr 27:24 \ft Some manuscripts specify "this just man's blood."\f*
\p
\v 25 Then all the people shouted in answer, "Let His blood be on us, and on our children!"
\p
\v 26 So he released Barabbas to them, and when he had had Jesus scourged, he handed him over to be crucified.
\p
\v 27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the garrison courtyard, and gathered the entire garrison together to watch Him. \f - \fr 27:27 \ft The Greek word \bd πραιτωριον\bd* or \it praetorion\it* is a Greek transliteration of the Roman word \it praetorium\it*, the headquarters of any garrison or, more specifically, the Praetorian or Palace Guard of the Emperor.\f*
\p
\v 28 And they tore His clothes off, and put a red infantryman's cloak on Him.
\p
\v 29 Then they wove together a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and put a reed in His right hand. Then they dropped to one knee before Him, and mocked Him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" \f - \fr 27:29 \ft The flimsy reed was their idea of a scepter.\f*
\p
\v 30 And they spat on Him, and took the reed away from Him, and batted Him on the head with it.
\p
\v 31 And after they were finished mocking Him, they took the war cloak off Him, and put his own clothes back on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.
\p
\v 32 As they were coming out, they found a man from Cyrene, named Simon. They forced him to carry His cross.
\p
\v 33 And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, i.e. "Skull Hill",
\p
\v 34 they gave Him a vinegar-and-bile mixture to drink. When He had tasted that, He wouldn't drink it.
\p
\v 35 And they crucified Him, and divided His clothes by a throw of dice, so that these \w prophetic\w* words might be fulfilled: "They divided my clothes among them, and threw dice for my apparel."
\p
\v 36 And they sat down and watched Him there,
\p
\v 37 and set up over his head his written accusation: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
\p
\v 38 Two robbers were crucified with Him, one to His right, and the other to His left.
\p
\v 39 And the passersby taunted him, wagging their heads,
\p
\v 40 and saying, "Hey, You! You said that You could destroy the Temple and build it in three days! Why don't You save Yourself? If You're really the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
\p
\v 41 In the same way the leading priests mocked him, together with the scribes and elders. They said,
\p
\v 42 "He saved others, but can't save Himself. If he's really the King of Israel, then He can dome down from the cross, and we'll believe Him.
\p
\v 43 "He trusted in God, so let Him deliver Him now, if He wants. After all, He said, 'I am the Son of God.'"
\p
\v 44 The robbers also, who were being crucified with Him, threw those same words in His teeth. \f - \fr 27:44 \ft Remarkably, that idiom survives today in English, even in a literal, word-for-word translation.\f*
\p
\v 45 Now from the sixth hour of the day, darkness fell over the entire country until the ninth hour. \f - \fr 27:45 \ft Hours of the ancient day were measured from sunrise. The equivalent phrase today would be "from noon until three p.m."\f*
\p
\v 46 And at about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "\it Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?\it*" That means, "My God, My God, why have You abandoned Me?"
\p
\v 47 Some of the bystanders, when they heard that, said, "He's calling for \w Elijah\w*."
\p
\v 48 Immediately one of them ran from Him, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to Him to drink.
\p
\v 49 The rest of them said, "Leave Him alone; let's see whether Elijah will come to save Him."
\p
\v 50 Jesus then cried out again in a loud voice and breathed his last. \f - \fr 27:50 \ft The literal idiomatic Greek phrase reads "gave up the breath."\f*
\p
\v 51 And at that moment the veil of the Temple was torn into two pieces from top to bottom, and the earth shook, and the rocks split, \f - \fr 27:51 \ft The Greek \bd Καὶ ἰδού\bd* in this context emphasizes the identical timing - ignoring ἰδού (or any word) in translation is disfavored. See, for example, the various translations of Καὶ ἰδού (depending on the context) to include "suddenly" and "at that time".\f*
\p
\v 52 And the graves were opened, and many bodies of dead saints rose up,
\p
\v 53 and came out of those graves after His Resurrection, and went into the Holy City, and appeared to many people.
\p
\v 54 The centurion, and those standing with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake and the other happenings. They were very much afraid, and said, "This must have been the Son of God."
\p
\v 55 And many women were there watching from a distance. They had been following Jesus ever since He began in Galilee, and used to wait on Him.
\p
\v 56 They included Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
\p
\v 57 That evening, a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, came. He also had been a student of Jesus.
\p
\v 58 He went to Pilate, and claimed the body of Jesus. The Pilate ordered the body turned over to him.
\p
\v 59 When Joseph had taken possession of the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
\p
\v 60 and buried it in his own new tomb, one that he had chiseled out in the rock. He had a large stone rolled across the entrance to the tomb, and went away.
\p
\v 61 And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting next to the tomb.
\p
\v 62 The next day, the day following the day of preparation, the leading priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate.
\p
\v 63 They said, "Sir, we remember what that Liar said, while He was still alive, 'After three days I will rise again.' \f - \fr 27:63 \ft Capitalized on account of Who He actually is, not on account of what the speakers thought He was.\f*
\p
\v 64 So give orders that the tomb be secured until the third day. We don't want His students to come in the middle of the night and steal His body, and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead.' If that happens, we'll have an even worse problem." \f - \fr 27:64 \ft The literal Greek idiom translates, "The last error will be worse than the first."\f*
\p
\v 65 Pilate told them, "You'll have a guard. Go and make it as secure as you can."
\p
\v 66 So they went, and secured the tomb by sealing the stone, and posted a guard. \f - \fr 27:66 \ft One assumes that this was a guard of Roman soldiers, not a Jewish Temple guard. The Sanhedrin could post its own guard over a tomb without asking for Roman authority, if it wanted.\f*
\c 28
\p
\v 1 After the Sabbaths, as the dawn began on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
\p
\v 2 And a great earthquake struck, because a Messenger from the Lord came down from heaven, came to the tomb, rolled back the stone from its entrance, and sat on it. \f - \fr 28:2 \ft The particular Messenger, or \w angel\w*, is not identified here.\f*
\p
\v 3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow.
\p
\v 4 And the guards shook out of fear of him, and passed out, like so many corpses.
\p
\v 5 And the Messenger said in answer to the women, "Don't be afraid. I know you're looking for Jesus, Who was crucified.
\p
\v 6 "He isn't here. He has been raised up, as He said He would be. Come and see the place where He was lying. \f - \fr 28:6 \ft Some manuscripts, including the Byzantine, have "where the Lord was lying."\f*
\p
\v 7 "And go quickly, and tell His students that He has been raised up from the dead. Look, He's going ahead of you into Galilee; you'll see Him there. I have told you."
\p
\v 8 And they went away quickly from the tomb, in fear and in great joy, and ran to bring word to His students. \f - \fr 28:8 \ft Some manuscripts have "And they went \it out\it* quickly."\f*
\p
\v 9 And as they were going to tell His students, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Hello, everyone." And they came and held Him by His feet, and kissed His feet.
\p
\v 10 Then Jesus told them, "Don't be afraid. Go and tell My brothers that they must go into Galilee. There they will see Me."
\p
\v 11 Now when they were going, some of the guards came into the city, and told the leading priests everything that had happened.
\p
\v 12 When the leading priests met with the elders and conferred with them, they gave a lot of silver pieces to the soldiers, \f - \fr 28:12 \ft How many silver pieces is never reported, but it must have been a very large bribe. (See below)\f*
\p
\v 13 and said, "Say, 'His students came in the night and stole Him away while we were asleep.'
\p
\v 14 "And if the governor hears about this, we will persuade him and keep you out of trouble." \f - \fr 28:14 \ft The penalty in the Roman army for sleeping on watch in a military situation was \w death\w*, so the soldiers would have welcomed the protection against punishment.  Whether that harsh penalty would have applied to soldiers in this context is less clear.\f*
\p
\v 15 So they took the bribe, and did as they had been instructed. This tale is commonly told among the Jews to this day. \f - \fr 28:15 \ft "σήμερον" can be translated as "this day" or even "this very day."\f*
\p
\v 16 Then the eleven students went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
\p
\v 17 And when they saw Him, they fell at His feet, but some had doubts.
\p
\v 18 And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All the power in heaven and earth is given to Me.\f - \fk 28:18 \ft This is the \w Great Commission\w*.\f*
\p
\v 19 "So go and make students from all ethnic groups, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Divine Guide,
\p
\v 20 "teaching them to keep absolutely everything that I commanded you. And remember that I am with you always, even to the end of the world." \f - \fr 28:20 \ft The Byzantine manuscripts add "Amen," i.e., "So be it."\f*
