This is a project I will likely never get back to.  

I did archive all of the books, but haven't addressed them in terms of conversion into USFM and trying to unpack the comments into footnotes like the original project plan.  I originally had a plan to link the first level links in comments into an appendix to the bible that formed something like a glossary.  But I don't know what I was thinking in terms of exactly how to accomplish it (wget is my main tool for this.) 

However, due to activity, and the project's removal from the conservapedia site, I'm throwing the files I did archive out there if someone wants them.  Note that I personally felt this project represented Conservatism and not scripture; and noone would think you could redact scripture based on 'Conservative thinking' as the project claimed to be following. But being what it is, [Here are the files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ApOISQaRrp6lYcINvEtgIJhyuy9ZqYlU?usp=sharing)
